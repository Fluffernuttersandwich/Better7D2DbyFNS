## Known Issues

1. MoreQuests not displaying properly and spilling over the UI box.

I will work with the author to obtain a fix, or find a different similar mod.  

The author JNS is usally really good about providing updates/solutions for this stuff.  

2. CAT UI additional toolbelt slots UI issue.

There is a workaround for now, but it's manual.
From NexusMods User: AkosEquilibrior
Regarding the CATUI_toolbelt_more_slot mod.  
The additional hotbar comes from CATUI (for 1.1 stable) - ZZZ_CATUI_toolbelt_more_slot
It bothered me, because the extra hotbar interfered with the crafting interface so i found a solution:
Open the mod folder there should be a folder "Config" then another "XUi" and in there a "windows.xml". 
Open this file with a text editior and change the value from 12 to 10. 
Or to something higher but under 24 if you want to use the additonal hotbar slots.

Or you could live it, or you could just disable the mod, your call.


3. These are some Warnings and Errors you will see when you load into the world.  

They can be safely ignored.  

Yes, I am working on fixing them eventually.  

However, I have played this ModList for hundreds of hours with these issues without catastrophic failures.
