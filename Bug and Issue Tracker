# As of midday 22DEC2024 EST, the Wabbajack admins told me there was a problem on the back end of the application and currently my list is down.  
It will be down until they fix it.  It's not a fault of the list, they are recompiling code to support the 7D2D game on WJ.  
'Sorry for the inconvenience, it's out of my control.

## Known Issues

1. These are some Warnings and Errors you will see when you load into the world.  

They can be safely ignored.  

Yes, I am working on fixing them eventually.  

However, I have played this ModList for hundreds of hours with these issues without catastrophic failures.
