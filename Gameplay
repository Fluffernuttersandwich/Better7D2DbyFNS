# Mod Notes

"Tool Time" mod: DO NOT ENABLE/DISABLE THIS MOD IN AN EXISTING SAVE OR IT WILL BREAK YOUR GAME!!!
Disable or Enable this mod prior to starting a new game and leave that setting as is!
This mod makes tools viable weapons... Ever wished axes and tool-hammers actually did real damage? Well, here you go.

Vehicle Cruise Control: When mounted in/on a vehicle, cycle the Q-key on the keyboard to switch from Slow, Sprint, and Off.

OCB's Parachute: You need the Parachute item mod installed on your chest armor, and a single use parachute item in your tool belt for it to work.
When falling from a great height, cycle to the parachute item in the toolbelt, and use it with the item use button. 
You will have limited control of the parachute, and still might take a minimal amount of falling damage. It's a test mod, not 100% perfect, but it's super fun!
