# Mod Notes

CAT UI and Health Bars: CAT UI is the standard for this Collection and comes with Health Bars turned on.
There is no way to cut the Health Bars out without causing the whole CAT UI to error.
So, if you don't like seeing Health Bars, and/or don't like the CAT UI mod, disable/remove the CAT UI Mod and use the AGF HUD instead.
I have confirmed the AGF HUD is compatible with this ModList. Additionally, the AGF HUD has an add-on for health bars if you like theirs.

"Tool Time" mod: DO NOT ENABLE/DISABLE THIS MOD IN AN EXISTING SAVE OR IT WILL BREAK YOUR GAME!!!
Disable or Enable this mod prior to starting a new game and leave that setting as is!
This mod makes tools viable weapons... Ever wished axes and tool-hammers actually did real damage? Well, here you go.

Vehicle Cruise Control: When mounted in/on a vehicle, cycle the Q-key on the keyboard to switch from Slow, Sprint, and Off.

OCB's Parachute: You need the Parachute item mod installed on your chest armor, and a single use parachute item in your tool belt for it to work.
When falling from a great height, cycle to the parachute item in the toolbelt, and use it with the item use button. 
You will have limited control of the parachute, and still might take a minimal amount of falling damage. It's a test mod, not 100% perfect, but it's super fun!

Bicycle Synnergy:
There are multiple bicycle mods that work in tandem in this ModList to allow you to craft the bicycle earlier from your backpack, and forge components.  
I also included my e-bicycle battery vehicle mod, that lets you go fast so you get more use out of the bike.
