2.1.1: TBD

Comments: 

1. The ModList has been updated for 2.1 STABLE.  
I make no promises that you can continue in the same save.  
You should either make a backup and be willing to revert the game to 2.0, or wait to update the modlist until you are ready to start a new game for 2.1+.

2. Adjusted VRoid to remove the excessive number of not fully functional Avatars.  
As Avatars are updated to 2.0, I will reintroduce them. 
This should bring the storage requirement down, and I apologize for not considering the size implication.

Mods Removed: 
1. All NPC mods.  
These might come back at some point in the future of the list, but I spent too much time testing to remove some bugs, and I can't find them all.
It's not the fault of the NPC-Core mod, it's just too many other mods on the list are throwing compatibility issue when I add in NPC-Core.
If I had to choose other mods I like to play with personally, over NPC-Core, I will always choose the other mods on the list.  

2. All of the mods that have not been updated for 2.x.  
All of the major Mod Authors have made the biggy updates that were easy fixes for 2.0.
Anything else could take substantially longer.
Most of the mods that have not been updated are for sound.  
Those actually are easy fixes, just a directory fix, but that's on them to fix their mods.  
Give them time.

Mods Added:
"Shared Reading"


Mods Updated: 
"VRoid"
"Score"
"True Third Person View"
