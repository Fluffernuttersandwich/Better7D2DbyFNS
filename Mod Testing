2.3.2.1 TBD

For Game version 2.3

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Comments:

1. Relatively small update.

Mods Removed: 

N/A

Mods Added:

"MoreQuests" Quests, enabled.
Allows for the trader to offer multiple (like 30) quests.
This mod previously caused problems on the list with mod compatibility.  
I tested it as thouroughly as I could, and din't notice any issues.
It works fine with the default list I give you.
It's possible, if you are adding other off-list Quest mods that add new quest types, that it could cause an error.  

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack07 The Walking Dead" Armor, enabled.
Adds armor and cosmetic options from TWD.

"(V2) Classic Crack-a-Book HQ POI" by arramus. POI, enabled.
Adds an updated version of the old tier 5 Crack-a-Book HQ.
Many people preffered the older version compared to the new one.
Note: I have not updated the Smorgasbord Maps yet, so if you want to see this POI, run a new Advanced RWG.  

Mods Updated:

"Rainstorm" You can expect another update to this one in the very near future.
"LittleRedSonja's CAS"
"Witos Camera"
"DanzoLootBagAndAnimalIncreaseTimer"
"Clopex Estate"
"Gella Park"
"Serenity - Cave Prefabs"
"7 Days of Insomnia"
"MXMRMXs poi pack"
