2.1.3 TBD

Return of the NPCs! 
For real this time!

This ModList works with game version 2.1b9.  

Big thanks to Xyth, the creator of the NPCCore mods. 
I asked, and Xyth was kind enough to host NPCCore from NexusMods. 
This fixed the NPCCore download issue we were having.
Please endorse his mods and say thanks to him for making them available to us.
When a mod author lends support to help Smorgasbord, please let them know you appreciate it.

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough.
