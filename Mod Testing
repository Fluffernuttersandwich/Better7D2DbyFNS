2.0.5: TBD

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough.  
I have been able to continue my same playthrough, but YMMV.

Comments: 

The ModList is still on 2.0b295 STABLE.  We are still on this version, because it's the latest Stable version.    

Mods Removed: 
All of the Requirement mods that were supporting the Closer Weapons Pack.  That pack is gone, and the reqs were duplicated in EFTX.

Mods Added:
N/A

Mods Updated: 
"Modded CompoPack" Stallion fixed a RWG error when you combined the CompoPack with Descent. Zyncosa_Mine
"High Performance Running Shoe footwear mod" Fixed localization bug
"LittleRedSonja & Mumpfy's ArmorPack01 DangerGirls" Small fixes.
"Firefly Avatar for VRoid" The author improved her shadow.  You might have to reload her to fix it.  I noticed it's improved, but still a little blinky.  
"VRoid" Improved OmniShadows on Avatars. Also Updated to allow a page-through the radial menu for additional dances.  I added the Dance pack mod to the main folder so it's now in the game.
