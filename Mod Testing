2.01: TBD

Comments: 
1. The Smorgasbord ModList is now exclusively compatible with 7 Days to Die game version 2xy.
This is a major revision to the list, you will need to RWG a new world and start a new game.
2. History has shown us that TFP will likely have several small hotfix version updates over the next few weeks.  
Every time TFP updates the game version, I will need to test everything again, supply new game hashes to Wabbajack, and update the list.
Please be patient while the game versions are in flux.
3. Reminder: I will never officially support Experimental versions.  
I will test them, and let people know in my fns-smorgasbord channel at Guppy's if they can use the list on an experimental version.
But I do not update the ModList until a version goes stable because bugs and lack of framework mod support can leave the list in a broken state.
If framework (requirement) mods have not been updated, I am forced to wait on them.  
4. Smorgasbord is now compatible with 7DVR, BUT (big BUT), you must unzip the latest supported version of 7DVR files directly into your base-game files.  
7DVR players using Smorgasbord can play in the same server as players with Smorgasbord that do not have 7DVR installed.  They need the same list of mods enabled/disabled!  

Mods with Status Changes:
"FPV Legs" changed to disabled because it messes up 7DVR.  If you are not playing with 7DVR, feel free to enable this mod.  
"Custom FPV FOV" changed to disabled because it messes up 7DVR.  If you are not playing with 7DVR, feel free to enable this mod.  

Mods Removed: 
"Laydor's Super Resolution (DLSS)" It's now natively supported in vanilla in 2.x.
"Sledgehammer book series" It's now vanilla in 2.x.
"Weather is Real - Lite" Temperature effects have returned to vanilla in 2.x.
