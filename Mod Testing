2.1.5.1 TBD

Major Revision.

Mods Removed: 

1. All of the mods under the Biome Progression Separator. Someone out there is gaspging; "Nani?!"
They were all replaced by Jawoodle & FuriousRamsay's "Better Storms Biome Progression and More"

Other modlets removed because they are now part of "Better Storms Biome Progression and More"
"Horn Opens Doors"
"TheMeanOnes Return of Empty Glass Jar"
"Reduce Insect Swarm Debuff"

"TiaoZaoMinimap" Quest Reward screen bug with "WMMTraderQuestMap" and "FNS Make Quest Rewards Great Again"

"QuickStack" keeps bugging out and causing mod conflicts. 

Mods Added:

"Nugz Vehicle Pack" Vehicles, enabled.
"Nugz Hover Board" Vehicles, enabled.

"Nugz Neon Lights" Decor, disabled. 

"Nugz Lasersword" OP, enabled. 
Adds craftable lightsabers.

"Hunlight Guppycur's Zombies Spawn Remaster" Zombie Spawning, enabled.
A lightweight patch that corrects the spawn progression of the Guppy Zombies mods, preventing powerful zombies from appearing in the early game for a more balanced experience.

"Izy's Pistols in Toilets, Cars, and Purses" OP, enabled.
Optional add-on for Izy so you have a very low chance of finding Izy pistols in those places after certain gamestages.

"(V2) NPC Mod Prefabs (NPC Mod Add On Pack)" NPC, disabled.
Adds a handful of Bandit POIs filled with hostile NPCs. 
You must RWG a new world with Score + NPCCore and this mod enabled. 

"CollectedItemListFix" QoL, enabled.
You know how when you collect too many items/resources, it can often jumble the display showing an overlapping mess of items piled on top of one another? 
This mod fixes that issue. 

"NVG Booster - an add-on for Better Lighting" Graphics, enabled.
Enable this along with either of the two Better Lighting mod versions. Drop your in-game Brightness setting to 0%, and this mod will help improve NVG display.

"Modern's Packages" OP, disabled.
Starter Kit, start with box of Tier 1 items.  
I prefer Hunlight's for balance, where you start with a box of Tier 0 items.

"Better Storms Biome Progression and More"
The best all in one weather storms and Biome Progression mods. 
If you listened to Jawoodles video to TFP on fixing 2.0, this is the mod that answers the mail.
