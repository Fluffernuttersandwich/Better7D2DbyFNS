Comments: 

1. Added VRoid Support.  It makes playing third person super fun.  
Currently only 3 of the default Avatars have full animation and hand placement support.  
We just need to wait on the mod authors to update their Avatars accordingly in time.  
And VRoid is not just for weebs, there's human looking characters too, not just cute anime girlies.  

2. Adjusted WalkerSim from Population Desnisty 300, down to 180.  Sorry, 300 was overkill.  
If you liked it that way, it's easy to adjust in the xml yourself.
I only learned I could proliferate xml/folder changes to players through Wabbajack today.  Neat!
