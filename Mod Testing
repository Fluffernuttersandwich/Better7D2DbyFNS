2.2.1.4 TBD

Reminder, the Smorgasbord ModList is currently on game version 2.2!

Standard warning: There's no gurantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Mods Removed: 

"POI Renamer" glitchy UI problems.

"Babel Inc POI" 
too much of a performance sink... 
overlapping lights, too many zombies spawning all at once, building is too large, too many reflective surfaces
It dropped my 80 FPS to like 20, and I'm not even playing with Better Biomes or Triple Infested POIs. 

Mods Added:

"Damage Numbers" UI, enabled.
This mod is UI agnostic. When you shoot zombies, it displays damage numbers over their heads similar to Borderlands.

"UI Sound Mod" Sound, disabled.
From Author: Simple mod that replaces some (57) of the more repetitious, arguably annoying sounds (hovering, clicks, opening the backpack etc). 
Customizable in xml. From Fin: The vanilla sound effects don't bother me personally, and the new ones are too mild for my taste.

Mods Updated:

"VRoid - Avatar - Master Chief from Halo 3"
"Drone Weapons"
"Blood Moon Chaos" Fixed the Quest Progression bug.

I moved a few mods out of Experimental, as I was able to test them more extenisvely.
