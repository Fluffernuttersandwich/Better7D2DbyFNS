2.1.4.4 TBD

Minor Revision.

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"Izy's Pistols in Toilets, Cars, and Purses" OP, enabled.
Optional add-on for Izy so you have a very low chance of finding Izy pistols in those places after certain gamestages.

"(V2) NPC Mod Prefabs (NPC Mod Add On Pack)"
Adds a handful of Bandit POIs filled with hostile NPCs. 
You must RWG a new world with Score + NPCCore and this mod enabled. 

"Screen Effects Be Gone"
Removes screen effects from your display when entering hazardous biomes before you complete the challenges. 
Keeps the biome danger buff icons active on the HUD, but clears the full-screen visual clutter on the borders of the screen. 
This is great for players who want a cleaner visual experience without nerfing the gameplay challenge of Biome Progression.

"CollectedItemListFix" QoL, enabled.
You know how when you collect too many items/resources, it can often jumble the display showing an overlapping mess of items piled on top of one another? 
This mod fixes that issue. 

"Halicopter" OP, enabled. New flying delivery drone. Can be sent from a POI you're working at loaded with stuff to dropp off at your base. 

"NVG Booster - an add-on for Better Lighting" Graphics, enabled.



Mods Updated:
"Oak's HeadHunters" added charged and infernals.
"Nerfed HeadHunters" adjusted values slightly.
"EFTX" minor update.
"MiniBosses"
"Additional Research" added the EFTX weapon mod schematics, but made them expensive for balance. 
"Jewelcrafting"
"LittleRedSonja CyberGirls NPCs" Less Rocket girls :P
"Additional Research" I took care of you wells!


Mod Note:
"WMMTraderQuestMap" from WookieNookie is having a conflict with "TiaoZaoMinimap". Disable one or the other or both. 
Vita Minimap works with Steel UI and "WMMTraderQuestMap"
