2.3.2.1 TBD

For Game version 2.3

Comments:

1. You might need to start a new save... this is not because that many mods updated, but because I have been disabling several mods.
There are so many changes, it could mess up your existing save.  
Like always, if you are happy with your current playthrough: WAIT, TO, UPDATE!

2. I found myself getting into a rut playing the same way over and over. 
My recent playthroughs were getting too easy.
So, I am making the default list more challenging.  By default, it will force the player to work harder for everything.  
I didn't add any grind, just disabled (but left in place) some mods that were too good.
I find it that when I am constantly desperate and barely surviving, I have a better time with 7DtD. 
If you don't legitmately fear death, you play sloppy, and you have less fun.

3. Caution: I edited WalkerSim settings. 200 Zombie population, and EnhancedSoundAwareness (sonic hearing) set to true. 
It appears the author Zeh_Matt has improved it, so it's not as overwhelming as it was.  However, stealth matters!
I want to try a playthrough with it set like this for a greater emphasis on stealth as a challenge. 
Recently I started watching TWD for the first time, and really liked the importance of stealth and speed.  
You are of course free to edit it to however you like.

4. Renamed the EFTX Separator to Weapons.  
It's EFTX, Izy AIO, add-ons to both, and other more popular weapon mods.  

Gratitude:
ALo, Feras, and the rest of the guys discussing the Headshot Only conversation in our Discord channel at Guppy's. 
I love productive brainstorming conversations that lead to cool mods and better ways to play.  

Mods Removed: 

"Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable" It's superfluous with "Quest Revamp".

Mods Added:

"MoreQuests" Quests, enabled.
Allows for the trader to offer more than 5 quests (how many depends on your UI).
This mod previously caused problems on the list with mod compatibility.  
I tested it as thouroughly as I could, and didn't notice any issues in our current load out.
It works fine with the default list I give you.
It's possible, if you are adding other off-list Quest mods that add new quest types, that it could cause an error.  

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack07 The Walking Dead" Armor, enabled.
Adds armor and cosmetic options from TWD.

"Guppycur's Fire AddOn to Score" QoL, enabled.
Back by popular request: Guppy's Fire adds Fire Extinghuishers, the ability to summon a biplane to drop water on an area, and other fire related goodies.
Previously, this mod was having errors in 2.0, but either something in a Score update, or the settings I selected for FireManagement fixed the errors we had. 
Caution, not tested on a Dedicated Server. If someone with a Dedi can test the Extinguisher on a fire, and check logs, that would be great.  
User sentiment: "Hey Fin, wouldn't it be nice to be able to you know, actually put out the fires, just sayin'."

"FNS No Crispies with Guppy's Fire Mod v2" QoL, enabled.
If you disable Guppycur's Fire, also disable this mod! 
Prevents Guppycur's Fire Mod from converting zombies set on fire to Burnt Zombies... I like molotovs to actually kill zombies, not just convert them to crispies!

"Remote Explosive Charges - with optional Safe Cracker add-on" QoL, enabled.
Portable explosives with remote detonation. 
One for breaking blocks, one for damaging zombies, one for safe-cracking. 
Don't like your undead neighbors car? Blow it up from your toilet! 
Want to expand your base but that pesky wall is in the way? 
Blow it up from a safe distance! Wanna just cause mayhem? It can probably do that too.

"Headshots Preferred by FNS" Survivalist, enabled.
Headshots do 33% more damage, body shots do 33% less damage.  
Mod Author ALo gave us this modlet, so please thank him if you appreciate it.
Recommendation from Fin: From a recent playtest, I think it might be best for most players to disable the Armored Zombies mod from EFTX if using this mod.  
Unless you really like an insane challenge. 
My reasoning is this: Feral zombies with helmets, especially Wights are brutal in the early-to-mid game when you don't have AP rounds.
They have high hit points, they get on top of you in the blink of an eye, and you already do low damage to their lower body.  
This could be fun for a minority of players, but this would be unpleasant to most.  

"Brain Dead Zed" Zombies, disabled.
From the Author: The zombies will, mostly, no longer act like structural engineers, bee-lining for the weakest part of your base from the far side. 
They will now, more so, approach and attack from the direction they saw you from. 
This acts a bit more like the old AI, or the AI from alpha 16, but without the issues from the time.
Most zombies are now 'stupid' zombies. 
Utility worker (construction) zombies retain the current 'smart' AI, and the Demolition zombie was given the 'smart' AI, making them far more dangerous.
Zombie Dogs and Dire Wolves were left untouched.
Be warned, your standard stilt cheese base will not work! 
Only a fraction of the zombies will use your stairs, unless you get very lucky and the horde just approaches from that direction.
From Fin: I disabled this by default because taking away a zombie's ability to climb stairs makes some POIs a worse experience. It's there if you want it. 

"No More Drill Claws" Zombies, enabled.
In vanilla 7 Days to Die, when a zombie has several 'allies' close by, they get a 20% block damage boost per 'ally.' 
So, when a horde is attacking a wall, they can easily tear through even the hardest blocks. 
For many people, this seriously breaks immersion, as a small group of rotting corpses will tear through a cubic meter of concrete in about the same time you can dig through it with an auger.
This mod addresses that problem by completely removing the feature. Zombies will no longer get any block damage boost when in groups. As a result, concrete walls actually act like concrete.

"GirlsFrontline Jiangyu RaindropCleavingBlades" Custom Avatars (VRoid).
Just another waifu.

"(V2) Classic Crack-a-Book HQ" POI, enabled.
Adds an updated version of the old tier 5 Crack-a-Book HQ.
TFP created the original POI, but arramus updated it for v2.
Many people preffered the older version compared to the new one.
"(V2) Atomic Burger" POI, enabled.
Adds in a reconstructed version of the base game's Wasteland rubble version which has been partially destroyed.
It is a T2 POI hooked up for fetch, clear, restore power, and Infested. It can appear in the commercial, downtown, and country residential locations.
Note: I have not updated the Smorgasbord Maps yet, so if you want to see these new POIs, run a new Advanced RWG.  

"Recipes for Resin by FNS" Standard, enabled.
This is a small Add-On modlet for the Archery Expansion mod. 
My mod adds additional recipes to allow for different uses of the Resin resource added to the game by the Archery Expansion mod. 
It provides new alternative recipes for: Torches, Glue, Aloe Cream, and Goldenrod Tea.

"Shrader's NPCs All-in-One" NPCs, disabled.
Adds a ton of new NPCs to the game. 
I only briefly playtested this mod, no errors, the NPCs spawned in game and functioned as expected. 

Mods Updated:

"LittleRedSonja's CAS"
"Witos Camera"
"DanzoLootBagAndAnimalIncreaseTimer"
"Clopex Estate"
"Gella Park"
"Serenity - Cave Prefabs"
"7 Days of Insomnia"
"MXMRMXs poi pack"
"(V2) Summon Animals (NPC Mod Add On Pack)"
"Enhanced LCB" Fixed, Standard, re-enabled. 
"LittleRedSonja Shopping Time"
"(V2) Oakraven Fish Farm"
"Medical conditions(alternative rest buff source)"
"Random Zombie Speed" This didn't update, but I dialed down the max speed from 3 to 2.5, since they were a little too fast. 
"WMMChangeColorOfCoalOnMap"
"WMMZAirdropSpawnZeds"

"Custom Avatars" This was previously called VRoid. 
If you have a problem with aiming, Aim Down Scope (ADS), go into this mod's menu golden hexagon in the character tab and uncheck "Aim Correction".
Alter created a workaround to remove the "third hand" when combining this mod with IZY AIO... however, it's not perfect.
Using Izy + Custom Avatar (VRoid) will still do a funny thing with the hands changing from 3rd person view to FPV when you ADS.
Your Custom Avatar hands will be temporarily be replaced with the Izy hands when you ADS when using Custom Avatar (VRoid).
This is because Izy does his hands differently than vanilla or EFT-O/X.
Izy currently does not have plans to update his hands.
If you play as a male character in the base game of 7DtD, but use a female Avatar, with Izy guns, you will switch to man-hands in ADS/1st Person View. :P

"Rainstorm" 
Laydor is seeking feedback on Fog. 
He added different levels of Fog, you can change this setting in the Gears Mods menu. 
He has Normal (vanilla game fog), Rainstorm (intended fog), and Silent Hill level of oppressive constant fog.
