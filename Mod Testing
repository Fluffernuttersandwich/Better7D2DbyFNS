1.43: TBD

Comments: 
The Smorgasbord ModList v1.43 is now compatible with 7DtD game version 1.4b8.
The new 1.4b8 stable version mostly fixed bugs, and did not add/subtract any features.
I did see some minor UI errors, 
but they didn't pop-open the console mid-game and I didn't see any game-breaking errors.  
I tested it for a few hours and didn't notice any other major problems.  
It's impossible for my testing to be exhaustive, so if you notice any new unreported issues,
please let me know so I can fix things.
