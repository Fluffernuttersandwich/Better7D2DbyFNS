2.2.1.3 TBD

Reminder, the Smorgasbord ModList is currently on game version 2.2!

Standard warning: There's no gurantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Mods Removed: 

"Apocalypse Friends MultiTrader" 
NexusMods Admins removed the mod, guessing someone uploaded another author's mods without permission.  

Mods Added:

"Oak's Big Foot NPC" NPC, disabled.
Adds Sasquatch to the game. I have not tested these for difficulty, please let me know and I can add a nerf patch.

"Vita Hardened Steel" OP, enabled.
adds a higher level of Steel and steel traps. 

"GNS Slashing Axes" Standard, enabled.
Makes axes do slashing damage instead of bludgeoning, so they realistically do more damage.

"Koames Turret Buffs"
"Izy_No_Crosshair"
"Better Storms Biome Progression and More"
"0-Score"
"Hunlight's Balancing mods"
"CATUI"
