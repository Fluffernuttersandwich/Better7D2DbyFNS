2.0.4: TBD

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough.  

Comments: 

The ModList is still on 2.0b295 STABLE.  We are still on this version, because it's the latest Stable version.    

Fin's Shout-out thank yous:

1. ShadowWolf579 for finding and squashing a bug with Tool Time.  It was making players lose experience when mining.
He also found the Beefy Reload issue below.  
2. All of the new people trying Smorgasbord for the first time.  Welcome, and glad to have you with us.  
3. Everyone testing, and being patient with the bugs we keep unearthing.  I can't do it alone, so I appreciate all the help from everyone.
