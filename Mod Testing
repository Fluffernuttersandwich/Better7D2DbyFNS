2.3.1.1 TBD

ALERT! The Smorgasbord ModList has moved to STABLE game version 2.3!
This will 100% require a new save!


Mods Removed: 

"Jareth Vehicle Turn Table" Errors.  We still have "VehicleSpinner V1" at home.  

Mods Added:

"Witos Hovercraft" Vehicles, enabled.
Adds Hovercraft.

"Player Movement Patch" QoL, enabled
Patches the game to fix issues with player movement. 
In particular, some issues related to sprinting occur when the sprint lock option is disabled. 
Therefore, if the sprint lock option is enabled, this mod will have no effect on sprint behavior.
Fixed an issue where tapping a key briefly would cause the player to continue sprinting even after the key was released. 
This behavior is commonly referred to as Toggle Sprint, and this Mod also disables Toggle Sprint if the Sprint Lock option is disabled.
Fixed an issue where releasing the sprint button after opening a container or inventory with the sprint button held down would cause the container or inventory to remain in sprint state even after closing it.
Fixed an issue where holding down the jump key would cause the player to jump again immediately after landing.

"Hunlight's 7DtD Rebalance" Survivalist, enabled.
Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)! 
Introduces a comprehensive progression system with delayed iron, steel, and mechanical advancement alongside stricter trader tier requirements. 
This standalone mod features balanced zombie XP, economy adjustments, and improved containers while remaining fully compatible with most other mods.

"TMO Crosshair Plus" UI Suite, enabled.
This mod is UI agnostic. Customizable Crosshair. 
Change shape, size, and color in the Console. 
For crosshair Console commands, see NexusMods documentation or video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST1SJtBBM9Y
