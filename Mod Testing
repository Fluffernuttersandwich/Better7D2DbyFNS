Comment:
Adjusted "Better Storms Biome Progression and More" disabled Horns open Doors feature, because I re-added the mod that does that back in.  
I like the mod version better for increased functionality.  Leave that setting disabled!

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"QuickStack" Standard, enabled. 
My fault, I was using an old version.

All of the Funukemaguro's Icon replacer mods. QoL, enabled.
