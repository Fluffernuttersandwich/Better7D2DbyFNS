1.53: TBD

Comments: 

1. You will 100% need to start a new save with this update.  
This is because of the changes made to EFTX.
On a positive note: 
StallionsDen segmented the EFTX gun assets in a separate component mod... 
This file will not be updated very often allowing revisions to this ModList to take you less time to download going forward.  
This will save you from updating those 5GB every time you need to update Smorgasbord going forward.  

FNS gratitude shout-outs:


Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"TheMeanOnes Zombies Can't Dig" 
Optional Zombie Spawning & Behavior mod, enabled by default.  Zombies will not dig unless you manually configure a type to do so in the xml file.  
I don't personally like digging zombies, especially how it screws up their pathing... like digging at the rim of a hole above you instead of dropping down towards you.    

"Timely Drones" 
Optional OP Mod, More reasonable recipe to unlock the drone earlier making it actualy relevant in time for it to matter in your playthrough.  

Updated: 

"Thor..."
"KFC..."
"LittleRedSonja Ammunition Recycling"
"LRS&Mumpfy's ArmorPack 01 Danger Girls"
"Zeebark POI Pack"
"Scomar82Hobac's Better Highlighted Containers"
"EFTX Suite"
