2.1.2: TBD

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough. 

Pretty sure this update will destroy an existing save. EFTX update and Weather Returns... 

Reminder: Adding your own mods to this ModList voids the warranty on getting assitance from FNS.  
I will work to reduce/eliminate issues in the list I provide you, but I cannot help you when you make your own additions.
It's not that I don't want to help you, it's just my time is limited.

Mods Removed: 
"PGz Massive Cities" swapped for "World Gen Tweaker".

Mods Added:

"LittleRedSonja Barbie Davidson Vehicle" Vehicle, enabled.  
Adds a Pink Barbie-themed Harley-Davidson to the game

"Vayben's Deployable Mineshaft" OP, enabled.
Portable Mineshaft spawner block. 
Create a mineshaft spawner block, deploy the block, activate the block, watch the magic as it hollows out a mineshaft. 
Mineshaft comes with a door, walls, hatch, and ladder down. Best placed on an ore vein. It hollows out dirt and stone, leaving the ore for you to mine at your leisure.  

"POIs Always Infested x3" Quest mod section, disabled by default.
Do not combine with "Harder Infestations". 
This might effect your FPS on higher tier POIs. 
This mod triples the amount of zombies spawning in all POI quests. 
Not just Infested missions, but all POIs will have triple the amount of zombies.  

"Collectible Toys" Decor, disabled.
Adds a set of collectible toys and a wooden shelf you can build to display them. 
"Nikke Standees - Collectible Toys Addon"
Must have "Collectible Toys" enabled! Adds 478 acrylic standees with art from Nikke. 
These are scantily clad anime waifu.

"NPCCore Suite" New Separator, all disabled by default.
NPCs are still a bit experimental and janky. 
NPCs will drastically change the game. Maybe play a test game for an hour or two before deciding you want to settle in to a long play with them.
By default, NPCs are common. They will also spawn in with WalkerSim.  
Some users complain NPCs are loud, annoying, and disrupt the more chill vibes of the vanilla apocalypse feel of the game. 
I added them to the list because some player like the dynamic variety they add.
Some of the add-ons bring in unkillable NPCs. Read the notes carefully.
Some of the add-ons are silly. Weird animals, friendly zombies with guns, robots, etc.  
I will continue to include more add-on NPC packs as they come online for 2.0.  I only included updated/functioning mods.

"Doros VRoid Avatar" VRoid, already added to the VRoid mod folder.
Another anime waifu.

"No More Storm Warnings" Biome, enabled.
Turns off the on-screen-display notification that a storm is incoming.
It makes for a more fun experience not knowing.

"World Gen Tweaker" POI, enabled.
"Randomized Traders (v2.1)" POI, enabled.
These mods allow for smaller and maps 2k-16k, cities in the forest biome, more cities, larger cities, and unlocks traders from specific biomes... Not just Rekt in forest.
I would reccomend 6k-12k maps in general. Smaller maps will give you trader issues.  Larger maps are really unecessary, slow to make, slow to load, but you do you.
This can make finding the Trader intially more difficult, read the troubleshooting notes.
Disable both if using CompoPack! CompoPack does it's own thing for RWG, and other mods that effect RWG settings can mess it up.

"Foggy Ridges 41 Colorful Smoke V2" Decor, disabled.
41 Variants of different color smoke using the chimney cap.

"Syrinuv JetArmorMod" OP, enabled.
Adds a JetPack armor mod. You won't hover in mid-air, it's more like a super long jump.
You must remove the helmet flashlight, and  not hold a Izy gun.
Press the F key to super long jump forward.
Do not use from a roof top unless you like broken legs.  Or, max out Parkor, or take the Oh Shitz Drops candy first.

Mods Updated: 

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack04 GNS Armors"
"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack05 TactiGirls"
"CATUI"
"Secret Base"
"Weather Returns"
"Zombie Fall Damage"
"Oakraven Chicken Coops"
"LittleRedSonja's Shopping Time" Added new optional Add-Ons to the main mod.
