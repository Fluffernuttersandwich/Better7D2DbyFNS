1.46: TBD

Comments: 

Regarding mods from Non-NexusMods offsite locations; I will use offsite mods if they link to GitHub/GitLab locations.  
I am not going to use mods that go to ModDB/G-Drives because they force users to download and install the mods manually.  

A. Izy's Vanilla Replacer.  Izy added a few small fixes.

B. Removed the Western NPC mod for two reasons.  
It was throwing errors and it required users to manually manipulate it for installation from ModDB.

C. EFT Extraction Pack was fixed.  
The Learn-by-Doing (LBD) system was removed.  
I have now set the Extraction suite back to enabled in MO2 by default.

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
Kajdaniec for helping me test the download process for the new offsite mods.  

Removed: 
"Western Entity Pack for NPC-Core"

Added:

"Guppy's Tin Can Grenade" Optional QoL mod.  
This mod does two things: 
1. Adds an empty tin can to the players inventory after consuming a canned food item. 
2. Adds a recipe that allows players to create small improvised (ghetto-rigged) Tin Can Grenades.
Throw it immediately or it will blow up in your hand.  

"Guppy's Motorized Shopping Cart" From LittleRedSonja, we ressurected a fun vehicle Guppy made years ago. 

"Better Pipe Guns" Optional OP Mod.  Increases the damage of the Pipe Rifle and Pipe Shotgun slightly, just to make them less useless.  

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy's DangerGirl ArmorPack01" Adds some new armor fo rthe ladies.  

"IncreasedStackSize" mods of various sizes.  

Updated: 

"Izy's Vanilla Replacer"
"EFT Extraction Pack"
"Oakraven's Balloons"
"TMO Trader Never Closes"
