1.49: TBD

Comments: 

1. Another hotfix on EFTX.  We leapfrogged from 1.4.0.6 to 1.4.0.8  
Always make a backup prior to updating the list if you are trying to play in the same save.  
There is no guarantee it will work.  Which is why I always recommend to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new save.
Again, I was able to continue playing in the same save of Smorgasbord from ModList versions 1.47 through 1.49 without issues, but your mileage may vary.  

2. Do not run MS Teams and 7DtD simultaneously.  Teams is a resource hog and will cause in-game loading to slow, and stutters in UI-menu screens.  
I have had dozens of other applications running concurrently without issue.  But Teams doesn't play nice.
I learned this the hard way.  I was pulling my hair out for an hour trying to figure out which new mod was causing my FPS to tank.  
Not a mod, just Teams.  Thanks Microsoft.

A. He suggested that I try adding ByteBlazar's "No Texture Streaming" mod to the list.
B. He discovered/reminded me that you can use the mouse to help make reading and scrapping faster.
RIGHT CLICK to read books/magazines, 
MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON (MMB) to scrap,
Shift + MMB drops item on ground

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"LittleRedSonja Fancy Zombie Variants" Zombie Spawning mod, enabled by default.  
Adds new reskins of vanilla zombies to give them more variety in clothing and coloration.  
I confirmed the reskinned vanilla zombies are still lootable with EFTX... pastel-suited businessman can still be looted.  

"No Texture Streaming" Optional Performance/Graphics mod, enabled by default.
For most users, it gives them a small performance boost making textures load faster.  
This mod disables Texture Streaming so the quality of textures is never reduced automatically. In theory, this can have a negative impact on performance but, in my experience, the difference is not noticeable at all.  
YMMV.  Hardware, Mods, Settings, and other running applications will effect if this mod will work for your setup. 
The game has a system called Texture Streaming that automatically lowers the quality of some textures based on heuristics to save system resources and improve performance, 
but Texture Streaming is not smart about it and makes many wrong calls, so you can easily end up walking around in a fully rendered world where only a few textures look very low quality (like the car in the image), and those really stand out. 
This is especially noticeable for players with mid or low-end PCs or with other mods that add new blocks with their own custom textures to the game, but even players with high-end PCs will sometimes notice these.
