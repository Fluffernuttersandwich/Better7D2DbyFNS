2.1.4.3 TBD

Minor Revision.

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"Score Changes Gears Edition" QoL, disabled.
Allows you to make what are normally xml edits in 0-Score, within the GEARS GUI menu. 

"The TechFreqs TLDR Auto Read Duke Note" QoL, Enabled.
Really nice QoL ultra-lightweight modlet removes the Duke’s note from your starting inventory.
It completely disables the annoying “Read this note if you want to survive” buff/message on new games. 
No more green tutorial text, no more clutter in your inventory—just a clean, distraction-free start every time!

Mods Updated:
"MoreGore"
"Stats in Description"
"Longer Lasting Buffs"
"QuickStack"
"EFTX" minor update.
