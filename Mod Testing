1.37: TBD

Comments: 
Updates to the ModList are usually dependant on other mods with their own dependencies getting updated.  
When the main EFT Overhaul ModPack updated this week, StallionsDen needed time to test the EFT Extraction Pack.
Then I needed a chance to update and test Smorgasbord with all of the new updates, so that is why this update took a little longer. 

Big thanks to Kajdaniec for creating, testing, and proving this list can work on a Dedicated Server.  
See the ReadMe on the GitHub page for reference.
