1.44: TBD

Comments: 
Users had a problem with Flogi's Perks Mod.  
It was updated so this revision of the Smorgasbord Modlist to 1.44 is mostly as a hotfix to that issue.  
While I was at it, I updated a few others... 

Notice:
EFT Extraction Pack and Izy are both planning an update in the near future, so the next update to Smorgasbord could be as quickly as today/tomorrow.   

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
EyeOfWolf for reporting the issue with Flogi's Perk Mod.

Removed: 

Two of the OakravenAmmoPress-CompatibilityAddOn patches (because they were consolidated under one new file).  

Added:

"RWG POI Blocker" 
Optional POI mod, set to Disabled by default in MO2.  
Manual modification is required!  
Prevents user specified vanilla POIs from appearing on maps created by the vanilla RWG.  
By default it is set to block a few strip club POIs from spawning, but can easily be customized with your own list of POIs.  
Some users might want to use this mod to blacklist POIs like modded traders.

"(V1)-OakravenAmmoPress-CompatibilityAddOn"
Optional OP Mod... this was a consolodation of two other mods into one file.  

Updated: 

"Flogi's Perk Mod"
"Flogi's Quest Mod"
"World Tower"
"LittleRedSonja Ammunition Recycling"
"(V1)-OakravenAmmoPress-CompatibilityAddOn"
