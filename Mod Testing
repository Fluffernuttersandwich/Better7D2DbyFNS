Added:
"Cloud's Combine Toolbox" OP Optional, enabled.  
Adds a special Green Combining Toolbox that you place in your backpack, exit the backpack UI, then re-enter the backpack menu screen.
Example: You have two tier 1 wrenches, you combine into one tier 2 wrench.  
If you don't see the third box of the Combining Toolbox filling up with the higher tier item, it's because you need to level up your Salvage skill.
With points into the Salvage skill, you can combine two of the same item to make a higher tier new version.  Up to tier 5!
This works with vanilla items, Izy guns, and EFTX guns.  

Updated:

"LRS&Mumpfy's ArmorPack02VanillaRevamp"
"EFTX Suite"
"Custom FPV FOV"
