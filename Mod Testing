N/A

Added:
"Advanced Junkyard" POI.
"SuperMax Prison" POI.
"Secret Base" POI.
"Koame's Turret Buffs": Extend turret activation range and by default you can have 3 turrets active.
"Additional Auger Blades": These tool-mods give the Auger longer/wider reach when mining to increase efficiency.
"More Armor Plates": Adds more armor-mods.
"Bump Stock": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Double Drum Magazine": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Fari's Pulse Rifle": Adds the M41A Pulse Rifle from the Aliens franchise...I'll likely add this to the Hadley's Hope POI.
"Remove Buried Supplies Quests by GR": This mod removes T1-3 Buried Supplies Quests from possible Trader Quest selections. 
This does not remove the initial Special Quest "Introduction Buried Supplies" quest when you first meet the trader in a new game... other mods do that already.

"Cedar Creek" POI.
"Barricaded House" POI.  
"TheMeanOnes Paintings Pack x Expanded x 39 Paintings"
"CP Modded Core"
"CP Modded Traders Only"
"CBP"
