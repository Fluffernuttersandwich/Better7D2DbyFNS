1.49: TBD

Comments: 

Another hotfix on EFTX.  
Always make a backup prior to updating the list if you are trying to play in the same save.  
There is no guarantee it will work.  Which is why I always recommend to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new save.
Again, I was able to continue playing in the same save of Smorgasbord from ModList versions 1.47 through 1.49 without issues, but your mileage may vary.

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"No Texture Streaming" Optional Performance/Graphics mod, DISABLED by default!
Do not combine with Resource Intensive mods like Urban Decay, Better Biomes, Thor, Descent, and possibly others.  
This mod is system/mod dependant.  
For some users, they see a rendering improvement.  
If you see your FPS drop significantly, disable this mod!  
When I tried to add it to a heavily modded game with all of those nice resource intensive mods, it dropped my FPS to 5.  
For another tester, not using resource intensive mods, playing at lower graphic settings, he saw improved texture loading without the FPS drop. 


Updated: 

"KFC"
"EFT Extraction Pack suite"
