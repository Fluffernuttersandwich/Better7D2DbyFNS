FNS Gratitude Shout Outs:

leopardtheboss: For offering his "Zombies eat gore" framework as opensource from his Descent mod.  I used it in my Bait Bag mod. 

Guppycur: For hosting the Discord server, and his kind words.  He's kept it going for a long time, and kept the community in a healthy state.

TFP: For addressing the community concerns to perform the needed course correction on Biome Progression. 
Not an easy decision I'm sure, but it was the right move.  

To the folks who hang out in my FNS channel at Guppy's... we get up to some fun banter and productive mod discussions.

The previous RWG and RWG-Trader mods.  Swapped back to the one from PGz, less headaches.

"WalkerSim" 
Now the zombies have much better hearing! Stealth will be a priority, especially in the early game.
Zombie Population Density has been set to 180 in the WalkerSim.xml file. Adjust it to your own liking.  
WalkerSim and NPCCore are now more compatible with eachother. 
If playing with NPCCore, you should see fewer NPCs since WalkerSim will not be spawning them.
Makes for a less frantic experience. 
If the Walker's hearing is too much for you, you can disable it in the xml: <EnhancedSoundAwareness>false</EnhancedSoundAwareness>
