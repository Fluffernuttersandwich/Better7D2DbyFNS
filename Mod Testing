2.3.2.1 TBD

For Game version 2.3

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Comments:

1. Relatively small update.

Mods Removed: 

"Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable" It's superfluous with "Quest Revamp".

Mods Added:

"MoreQuests" Quests, enabled.
Allows for the trader to offer more than 5 quests.
This mod previously caused problems on the list with mod compatibility.  
I tested it as thouroughly as I could, and didn't notice any issues.
It works fine with the default list I give you.
It's possible, if you are adding other off-list Quest mods that add new quest types, that it could cause an error.  

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack07 The Walking Dead" Armor, enabled.
Adds armor and cosmetic options from TWD.

"(V2) Classic Crack-a-Book HQ POI" POI, enabled.
Adds an updated version of the old tier 5 Crack-a-Book HQ.
TFP created the original POI, but arramus updated it for v2.
Many people preffered the older version compared to the new one.
Note: I have not updated the Smorgasbord Maps yet, so if you want to see this POI, run a new Advanced RWG.  

"Guppycur's Fire AddOn to Score" QoL, enabled.
Back by popular request: Guppy's Fire adds Fire Extinghuishers, the ability to summon a biplane to drop water on an area, and other fire related goodies.
Previously, this mod was having errors in 2.0, but either something in a Score update, or the settings I selected for FireManagement fixed the errors we had. 
Caution, not tested on a Dedicated Server. If someone with a Dedi can test the Fire Extinguisher, and check logs, that would be great.  



Mods Updated:

"LittleRedSonja's CAS"
"Witos Camera"
"DanzoLootBagAndAnimalIncreaseTimer"
"Clopex Estate"
"Gella Park"
"Serenity - Cave Prefabs"
"7 Days of Insomnia"
"MXMRMXs poi pack"
"(V2) Summon Animals (NPC Mod Add On Pack)"
"Enhanced LCB" Fixed, Standard, re-enabled. 
"LittleRedSonja Shopping Time"
"(V2) Oakraven Fish Farm"
"Medical conditions(alternative rest buff source)"

"Custom Avatars" This was previously called VRoid. 
Alter fixed the "Third Hand" issue with Izy AIO, with a new workaround where your 3rd person character switches to AimDownScope (ADS). 
Unfortunately, it introduced a new problem with ADS randomly pointing 90-degrees away from where you meant to aim when used with 3rd person. 

"Rainstorm" 
You can expect another update to this one in the very near future.
Laydor is adjusting the fog.

"Random Zombie Speed" This didn't update, but I dialed down the max speed from 3 to 2.5, since they were a little too fast.
