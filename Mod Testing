Comments: 

1. With EFT becoming massively popular, players kept asking me if it was compatible with my Mod List.  
It's not.  However, StallionsDen was working on EFT/Izy weapons compatability.  I helped him with playtesting balance and troubleshooting some problems.
Now we have his "EFT Extraction Pack" as a mod for the list if you are a gun nut.  It's nearly 6 Gb, so don't complain about the size, it is what it is.  
EFT weapons will water down the ammo, ammo ingredient, and weapon loot tables.  That can't be helped.  
After playtesting with it for a while, I noticed ammo production will be crucial, because you will never find your flavor of ammo in large quantities.  
Because of that, I am worked on expanding Oakraven's Ammo Press workstation to support Izy and EFT ammo.

2. I originally held off on adding Oakraven's stuff, because I wasn't sure if it would add loot bloat, or uneccessarily complicate the game.  
Players kept asking, and I finally decided to try using them in the list.  They intuitively work in the game, and no loot bloat.  

3. The Descent.  This is a brand new and EXPERIMENTAL mod.  It is disabled by default, only opt-in if you are willing to be a guinea pig.  It's pretty awesome though!
