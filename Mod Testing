1.21: TBD
Added: "Legend Perks Compatibility Patch".  This tweaks the "Legend Perks" mod so you only gain 1 Perk Point per level (and not 2).  
Updated: "Sensible Lootz"
Updated: "7 Days Super Resolution(DLSS)"
Updated: "Better 7D2D ModList POI Pack"
Updated: "Mod Organizer 2 Plugin"
Updated: "Clopex Estate"
Removed: "No Nerd Pole", it was deleted from Nexus Mods.  
Removed: "OG Trader Joel Voice Lines".  Error.
Removed: "PGz All Map Size generator v1". Redundant with the Modded CompoPack.
Removed: "World Gen Tweaker". Redundant with the Modded CompoPack.
Removed: "Unlocked Traders". Redundant with the Modded CompoPack.
Note: There was a problem with one of the CompoPack POIs, but it was one of my own mods causing the issue.  I fix my mod, updated it, and that fixed the compatability issue with the CP.  


 

Future Plans:
Working with Donovan to see about fine tuning a Load Order solution for MO2/Wabbajack.
