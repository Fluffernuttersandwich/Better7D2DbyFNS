Testing for ModList version 1.5

updating my two POI Packs... vanilla-izing the spec-req POIs for normies.  


Future Plans:

I think Izy will be updating his AIO Gun Pack to 4.0 in the near future, so I will likely wait and test again with those.  

And Stallionsden will be adding a fun surprise in the CBP I plan to use soon!
