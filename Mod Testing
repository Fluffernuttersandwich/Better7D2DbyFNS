2.2.1.4 TBD

Reminder, the Smorgasbord ModList is currently on game version 2.2!

If you are not ready to start a new save, wait to update the list!
EFTX received a major update! This means you will 100% need to start a new save. 

Mods Removed: 

"POI Renamer" 
Was causing too many glitchy UI problems.

"Babel Inc POI" 
Too much of a performance sink... 
overlapping lights, too many zombies spawning all at once, building is too large, too many reflective surfaces.
You (might) get away with one of those problems, but all at once, it kills your FPS.
It dropped my 80 FPS to like 20, and I'm not even playing with Better Biomes or Triple Infested POIs. 

Mods Added:

"Damage Numbers" UI, enabled.
This mod is UI agnostic. When you shoot zombies, it displays damage numbers over their heads similar to Borderlands.

"UI Sound Mod" Sound, disabled.
From Author: Simple mod that replaces some (57) of the more repetitious, arguably annoying sounds (hovering, clicks, opening the backpack etc). 
Customizable in xml. From Fin: The vanilla sound effects don't bother me personally, and the new ones are too mild for my taste.

"Tip of the Spear by FNS" Standard, enabled.
Just a small boost to the Spear Hunter book series to keep the spear more relevant into late game... 
I felt it was left behind by the sledgehammer, stun baton, etc. Spear is one of the greatest melee weapons ever made and games rarely do it justice. 

Mods Updated:

"VRoid - Avatar - Master Chief from Halo 3"
"Drone Weapons"
"Blood Moon Chaos" Fixed the Quest Progression bug.
"EFTX" Major Update!

I moved a few mods out of Experimental, as I was able to test them more extenisvely.
