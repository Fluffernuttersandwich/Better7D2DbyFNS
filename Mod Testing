1.48: TBD

Comments: 

Hotfix for EFTX and a few other small mods.  
I was able to update EFTX from 1.4.0.5 to 1.4.0.6 and continue playing in the same save. 
I was able to go from Smorgasbord v1.47 to 1.48 in the same save.  
It's always recommended to start a new game when you update this list, but you could make a backup and try.  It worked for me. 

FNS gratitude shout-outs:

Once again, to StallionsDen for the improvement and quick fixes to EFTX.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Zombie Hunter Scifi Minimap"
"Zombie Hunter Scifi Minimap - Visible Enemy Dots"
These are both UI Mods, they're optional, and disabled by default. 
This mod adds a Sci-Fi themed Minimap to the bottom right corner of the screen.  
One version shows enemy dots on the minimap, the other doesn't.
Animal mobs (both hostile and prey types) do not show up as dots on the minimap.
You can play with the minimap settings under the GEARS "Mods" section in the Game's Menu Options.
GEARS Mods > Quartz > Minimap tab.  
The minimap has an overlap with the Steel-UI 15-slot toolbelt.  
You can live with it, use a different UI, disable the 15-Slot toolbelt, or use the Immersive Toolbelt mod so it's less of an issue. 
I actually tried both the Zombie Hunter and Scifi UI mods, but neither worked.  So, all we get is this optional Scifi minimap for now.

Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack suite"
"Ammo Press Add-On Patch for EFT and Izy" Minor mispelling in xml, my bad.  
"Rodent Reducer" I added an additional remover xml file because they kept spawning in some calls.
