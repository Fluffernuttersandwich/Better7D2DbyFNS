2.1.1: TBD

Comments: 

1. The ModList has been updated for 2.1 STABLE.  
I make no promises that you can continue in the same save.  
You should either make a backup and be willing to revert the game to 2.0, or wait to update the modlist until you are ready to start a new game for 2.1+.

2. Adjusted VRoid to remove the excessive number of not fully functional Avatars.  
As Avatars are updated to 2.0, I will reintroduce them. 
This should bring the storage requirement down, and I apologize for not considering the size implication.

Mods Removed: 
All of the mods that have not been updated for 2.x.  
All of the major Mod Authors have made the biggy updates.
Most of the mods that have not been updated are for sound, or NPC add-ons.  
Give them time.

Mods Added:
"Shared Reading"


Mods Updated: 
"VRoid"
"Score"
"True Third Person View"
