Comments:

Over the last several months I have been trying to improve the "default" mods enabled in Smorgasbord to make it a more balanced experience. 
With this latest update, I am trying to steer the "default" experience to be more intricate and challenging. 
When I say intricate, I don't mean unnecessarily confusing, I'd hate that. I'm aiming for pleasantly complex, while remaining intuitive.  
I want the player to have to manage more for a grittier game experience where decisions matter.
And I also love the random interruptions from mods like: Blood Moon Chaos, Better Storms, WalkerSim, and Random Zombie Movement.

I have changed the name of the catch-all separator to "Survivalist".
I also used a uniform phrase you can filter by in MO2 "Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)!"
A CBM is anything that adds a layer of complexity, challenge, or thoughtful change to provide a more stimulating experience over vanilla.  
For a long time people have viewed Smorgasbord as just "whatever you want it to be" which it still can be depending on how you personalize your experience.
But, for a default experience, I really want to deliver something with character.
People hate bland play-it-safe games, they want a memorable experience.  

As you all have seen, A16 is all the rage right now. 
If I was to try and condense the main attractions of A16, I'd say this: Sophisticated players want a more engaging game.
2.0 vanilla is too dumbed down.  So how can Smorgasbord's default-as-delivered Mod List offer players what they really want?

1. Non-linear experience: People hate being railroaded to the same path every game.
With the mods I selected and modified, I have tried to offer the freedom players want without removing or completely overhauling existing systems. 

2. Intricacy: They want complexity without convolution. 
Survival games should not resolve all survival issues too early into a playthrough.
I really think the mods I've recently added and tweaked, will scratch that itch.
Better Storms, Immersive Survival, Medical Conditions, Insomnia. 

I understand not everyone is going to like Medical Conditions or Insomnia, but again, they can just disable them.
However, I think people should try them to see how it makes for a grittier game where your choices and skill matter.

Getting injured early game has serious consequences with Medical Conditions.

Insomnia forces you to manage sleep and the safety of your sleeping area. 
You have to more carefully plan your forays into the world.
Even though I have personally moved away from classic horde base construction in recent playthroughs, 
I do like feeling the pressure of securing a place to sleep out of the elements.



Mods Removed: 

N/A

Mods Added:

"Darks Soldierz" NPC, disabled.
Adds neutral/ally Soldiers.

"Darks Cleanerz" NPC, disabled.
Adds hostile Soldiers.

"Arrows And Bolts Cause Bleed" OP, enabled.
Vanilla Arrows and Bolts cause bleeds, if you take points in the Deep Cuts Perk.
I don't think it's too OP, I think it just helps keep archery relevant in the middle-to-late game.

"ProjectileBleedMod" OP, disabled.
Vanilla guns cause bleeds, if you take points in "Deep Cuts".
"IZY_Bleed_Patch" OP, disabled.
Vanilla and Izy guns cause bleeds, if you take points in "Deep Cuts".
Both of these were disabled by default because in my opinion, guns don't need a buff in Smorgasbord.

"IZPrebuilt's Improved Loot Experience" OP, enabled.
This mod aims to add more immersion, choice and risk vs reward to 7 days to die 2.0
by adding a bunch of low level T1 and T2 items back to the logical loot table like what was already in the game a few alphas ago. 
It adds tools to tool containers and guns and weapons to gun containers. Recommend new playthrough, with hard zombies to compensate.

"Rope and Realism" Survivalist, enabled.
Makes rope a required resource to craft as an ingredient in some recipes to increase immersion and complexity.

"Nails and crafting adjustments" Survivalist, enabled.
Adds nails as a requirement ingredient to crafting recipes that would logically require them.
Adds nails as resource items received when salvaging several blocks. Adds nails to stone tools crafting, generally to replace duct tape.
The point of this mod is to make nails more important since they are only needed for the Workbench and then you never use them again in the vanilla game.  

"Immersive Calendar" UI, disabled. 
Does not work with CAT and Steel UI, only when using the vanilla HUD. 
A small modlet that changes the date display below the compass.

"Medical Conditions" Survivalist, enabled.
Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)! 
Adds complexity to medical conditions for a more challenging game. 
Adds around 50 negative medical conditions to enhance survival experience. 
Identical symptoms from different conditions dont stack(With few rare exceptions).
Vanilla food and medications gain new meaning as a treatment to those conditions.
Added vitamins system to back up hypovitaminosis.
Variety of biome-specific conditions and ways to surpass them.
Some vanilla perks ineract with medical conditions in an intuitive and predictable way.
Medical conditions are hidden by default. 
To reveal them, players must diagnose them by either: having the corresponding Physician perk level (1â€“3), or reading enough Medical Journals (25, 50, or 75). 
Higher Perception reduces the required number of Medical Journals. Players can check allies by standing next to them.

"ByteBlazar's Screamers" Zombies, enabled.
Makes Screamers silent until they shout their Alarm. 
Also replaces vanilla screamers with Feral and Radiated versions. 
So if you are mining away, or hanging out in your base, 
you will not be able to distinguish normal zombies thrashing around outside your base with a Screamer until she shouts the alarm.
Their movement is also uniquely creepy.  

"New Spawn Start Zone" Survivalist, disabled.
Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)! 
This mod requires you to manually edit the xml to allow you to pick a different starting Biome.
For you hardcore nutters, you can now spawn into a different biome and be forced to survive its hardships immediately. 

"CrouchStaminaRegeneration" OP, disabled.
Crouching makes your stamnia regenrate much faster. Too OP!

"Faster Paintbrush and Infinite Paint" Standard, enabled. 
Self-explanatory.

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack06 Resident Evil" Armor & Decor, enabled.
New RE inspired Armors!
