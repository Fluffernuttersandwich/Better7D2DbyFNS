Comments: 

You will need to start a new game with this update, because the EFT Extraction Pack received another major update. 

FNS gratitude shout-outs:


Removed: 
"TechFreqsBackToMainMenuMod" The author informed me it had a significant error issue depending on how it was used.  Removing for now.  

Added:

"Additional Research - add-on patch" OP Optional. This is an add-on patch to the Research mod. I made this to allow EFTX players to craft magazines from the Research Workstation.
"Rodent Reducer add-on patch for Urban Decay" Optional, under graphics-performance separator, just to keep it near Urban Decay.  This reduces rat/bat spawns by 90%.  
"Crouching Doesnt Make The Screen Go Dark" Optional QoL, enabled by default. 
"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack02 VanillaReVamp" Decor/Armor.  
"(V1) Vehicle Mods Crafting Skill" Reading Vehicle Magazines unlocks vehicle-mods.  
"TheMeanOnes Interchangable Skies" Optional QoL.  I disabled "Galaxy..." and enabled this one to do the same thing.  Both are there, choose one.  
"TheMeanOnes Loot Indicators"
"LittleRedSonja Timber Inc Table Saw" Standard, enabled.  Adds a new Table Saw workstation where you can trade dukes for stacks of wood.  
"LittleRedSonja Normalized Craft Times" Optional QoL, disabled by default.  Balances crafting times... some are shorter, most are longer.
"LittleRedSonja Flying Fancy Magic Broom" Vehicle mod, enabled.  For those of you who want to fly around on a broom.  
"LittleRedSonja Shopping Time FULL version" Optional OP, disabled by default (because it's really OP).  
This mod adds a craftable "Online Shopping Terminal" that allows you to buy, 24/7, from a selection of rare, difficult to find or highly demanded items, such as solar cells, engines, learning elixirs, duct tape, candies and much much more.
