2.1.2.3 TBD

This ModList works with game version 2.1b9.  

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough. 

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:
"Wasteland Cuisine" adds new recipes using existing ingredients, so no loot bloat.

Mods Updated: 

"GNS Beautiful Bases"
"Alternative Biome Progression"
"Tool Time" 
"Witos Camera"
"NPCCore Suite"
"VRoid" Added new Avatars.

Mod Status change:

I Broke "NPCCore" into sub-component mods. So, if you want to play with normal NPCs, but not robots, you can disable robots individually.

"Descent" I did just figure something out.  I was getting some lighting flickering at night outside.  
It was Descen't cave-lights folder.  The author told me I could safely remove it.  I am removing it going forward.
