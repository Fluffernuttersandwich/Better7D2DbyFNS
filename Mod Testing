Added:
"Koame's Turret Buffs": Extend turret activation range and by default you can have 3 turrets active.
"Remove Buried Supplies Quests by GR": This mod removes T1-3 Buried Supplies Quests from possible Trader Quest selections. 
This does not remove the initial Special Quest "Introduction Buried Supplies" quest when you first meet the trader in a new game... other mods do that already.


Updated: 
"TheMeanOnes Paintings Pack x Expanded x 39 Paintings"
"CP Modded Core"
"CP Modded Traders Only"
"CBP"
