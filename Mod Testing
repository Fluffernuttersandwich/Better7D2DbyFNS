1.13: TBD
Removed: All three OSD mods because they cause an FPS crater in some of the CompoPack POIs.  
Removed: Both WookieNookie Named Zombies and Animal mods.  They had a minor conflict of not naming new mob types.  
Status Change: Disabled Trader Quest Addendum, awaiting update... if used now, you won't get the option of vanilla quest types.  
 

Future Plans:
Working with Donovan to see about fine tuning a Load Order solution for MO2/Wabbajack.
