Testing for ModList version 1.4

1. Stallionsdens Supply Crates was recently updated so that will be included on the next update.

2. I might make Guppy's Fire Mod Optional QoL, but with the caveat that once you enable, don't disable in the same save world.  

3. I think Izy will be updating his AIO Gun Pack to 4.0 in the near future, so I will likely wait and test again with those.
