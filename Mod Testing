Comments: 

Hotfix for EFTX and a few other small mods.  
You might need to restart a new game because of the EFTX fixes to progression.xml.  
Sorry guys, there were bugs, they've been fixed. 

FNS gratitude shout-outs:

StallionsDen for the tremendous effort he pours into EFTX.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Zombie Hunter Scifi Minimap"
"Zombie Hunter Scifi Minimap - Visible Enemy Dots"
These are both UI Mods, they're optional, and disabled by default. 
This mod adds a Sci-Fi themed Minimap to the bottom right corner of the screen.  
One version shows enemy dots on the minimap, the other doesn't.
Animal mobs (both hostile and prey types) do not show up as dots on the minimap.
You can play with the minimap settings under the GEARS "Mods" section in the Game's Menu Options.
GEARS Mods > Quartz > Minimap tab.  
The minimap has an overlap with the Steel-UI 15-slot toolbelt.  
You can live with it, use a different UI, disable the 15-Slot toolbelt, or use the Immersive Toolbelt mod so it's less of an issue. 

Updated: 

"EFTX-Core-Standard"
"ZEFT Extraction No Vanilla Guns"
"Ammo Press Add-On Patch for EFT and Izy"
