2.1.1: TBD

Major Revision Warning!
The Smorgasbord ModList has moved to Stable game version 2.1b7.
You will most likely need to start a new game!
If you ignore this advice and try to move your 2.0 game to a 2.1 game with this ModList, it will most likely destroy your game!
I tested this on two tester worlds I had in 2.0, and it broke both of my test saves.  
You could try making a backup, but here's your boy Fin telling you that it's probably a waste of time.
There's no reason to update the game/list if you are happy to continue in your current playthrough!
You are not missing out on any major uplifts, just wait to update both until you start a new game!
YOU WERE WARNED!

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"Armor Racks" Decor & Armor, enabled.
Adds an Armor Rack to display suits of armor.  This returned after it's update.  

"Gouki's Trader Smoothies" Biome Progression, enabled.
Adds Biome Smoothies to trader vending machine inventories.

"Plant on Dirt" OP, disabled.
You don't need a Farm Plot, now you can plant seeds on existing dirt, or create a dirt block (from clay).
Reminder, a dirt block is an earthen brown dirt looking block, not the normal grass block that yields clay when you dig it up. 
Nor is it sand. Dirt is uniquely it's own block in the game.  
OP, disabled by default.  

"Better Lighting" Graphics... enabled.  
This is one of two lighting options now available for the ModList. 
Choose this mod, or "World Lighting Tuned", but not both. 
Better Lighting adds a more natural Eye Light Adaption phase between sunny and shaded areas for more realistic lighting.
You can go to that NexusMods page and also download the ReShade manually and add it to your own game if you so choose.
I do not add/offer ReShades to this ModList.  Watch a YouTube video if you want to know how to use ReShade.
I find the World Lighting Tuned to be darker, and less realistic, but I like it's deeper darkness and color saturation levels.  
Lighting purists will prefer Better Lighting's more realistic shadows and eyesight light-level acclimation.  

"Drone Weapons" OP, enabled. 
Adds weapon mods available to the drone. 
You add the weapon mod to the drone itself within your backpack, deploy the drone in game, add the specific drone-weapon-mod ammo to it's drone inventory.
Then you can give the drone simple combat orders with the Tab key radial menu. 
Just set it to 'fire at will'.
I like it, but for late game when you don't care about stealth.

"Weather Returns"
Weather Returns seeks to bring back and expand upon the pre-2.0 temperature and weather system. Below are some of the key features of Weather Returns:
Body temperature makes a return
Wetness makes a return
Hypo- and Hyper-thermia resistance make a return on all armor sets
Insulated Liner and Cooling Mesh Return
New All Season Liner mod
New TPU Liner mod (waterproof)
New Insulated TPU Liner mod
New Cooling TPU Liner mod
Hot, Sweltering, Cold, and Freezing debuffs make a return
Hot now makes you thirsty, decreases stamina regen, and decreases weapon handling and reload speed
Sweltering does all that hot does, but worse. You will also occasionally become heat-stroked, and be stunned for a few seconds
Cold now makes you hungrier, decrease stamina regen, and slows down scavenging, crafting, lock picking, and reloading. Lockpicks will also break more often.
Freezing does all that cold does, but worse.
All weather debuffs will slowly make your character weaker, decreasing your max health the longer you stay outside of homeostasis. Get back to a comfortable temperature to regain your max health!
Get back your health faster by cooling down under some shade or in water, or by heating by a warm fire
Campfires and torches dry you off and warm you
Desperate for warmth? Set yourself on fire!
Various drinks now give you the "Cooled" buff, helping you stay cool for a period of time
Various drinks now give you the "Warmed" buff, helping you stay warm for a period of time
Coffee, Blackstrap, and Yucca Juice Smoothies get their temperature insulating properties back
Old Yucca Juice Smoothie bug fixed, now cools you down instead of heating you up
From Fin: I have tested this with the other Biome Progression mods enabled with this section.  If you see something concerning, please let me know.
