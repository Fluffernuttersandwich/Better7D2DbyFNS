1.59: TBD

Comments: 

Planning for 2.0.  Once it releases in experimental, I will be checking/fixing my own POI Pack first and foremost.  
Then checking my other mods still work in 2.0.
After that, I will be testing Smorgasbord with 2.x while it's in the experimental beta.  
As a reminder, I will not publish an update to Smorgasbord until game version 2.x goes STABLE!
I only support Stable releases because I have had it bite me in the past.  
I can keep you guys aware of the changes in my channel at Guppy's.
If it appears to be working in 2.x experimental, I'll let you know there.  


FNS gratitude shout-outs:
1. Mayers and 𝕷𝖊𝖌𝖎𝖔𝖓 𝖆𝖞 𝖇𝖆𝖇𝖔𝖞.  For reporting/suggesting we fix the lack of Queen Bees when using Better Biomes with Oakraven's Bee Hives.
2. Arramus and Oakraven for providing that Bee Hive patch for Queen Bees with Better Biomes.  
When Smorgasbord Community members report issues, it sometimes benefits people outside of our group too.  
So, good job everyone involved.
3. Kajdaniec, for providing assistance to other community members in setting up Smorgasbord as a Dedicated Server.
