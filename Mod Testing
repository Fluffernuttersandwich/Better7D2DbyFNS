Testing for ModList version 1.3
Immersive Crosshair 
Dot Crosshair
trying these mods after Izy's mods, late in the Load Order, Enabled, under the Optional QoL Mods separator.  
They work, and will be added to 1.3.  

I think Izy will be updating his AIO Gun Pack to 4.0 in the near future, so I will likely wait and test again with those.
