2.1.4.4 TBD

Minor Revision.

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"Izy's Pistols in Toilets, Cars, and Purses" OP, enabled.
Optional add-on for Izy so you have a very low chance of finding Izy pistols in those places after certain gamestages.

"(V2) NPC Mod Prefabs (NPC Mod Add On Pack)"
Adds a handful of Bandit POIs filled with hostile NPCs. 
You must RWG a new world with Score + NPCCore and this mod enabled. 

"Screen Effects Be Gone"
Removes screen effects from your display when entering hazardous biomes before you complete the challenges. 
Keeps the biome danger buff icons active on the HUD, but clears the full-screen visual clutter on the borders of the screen. 
This is great for players who want a cleaner visual experience without nerfing the gameplay challenge of Biome Progression.



Mods Updated:
"Oak's HeadHunters" added charged and infernals.
"Nerfed HeadHunters" adjusted values slightly.
"EFTX" minor update.
"MiniBosses"
