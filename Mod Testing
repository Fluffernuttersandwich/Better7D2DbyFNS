1.36: TBD

Comments: 
Be mindful of the two new Environmental mods as they are Resource Intensive and could drag your performance down.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:
"Advanced Junkyard" POI.
"SuperMax Prison" POI.
"Secret Base" POI.
"Koame's Turret Buffs": Extend turret activation range and by default you can have 3 turrets active.
"Additional Auger Blades": These tool-mods give the Auger longer/wider reach when mining to increase efficiency.
"More Armor Plates": Adds more armor-mods.
"Bump Stock": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Double Drum Magazine": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Fari's Pulse Rifle": Adds the M41A Pulse Rifle from the Aliens franchise...I'll likely add this to the Hadley's Hope POI.

"Better Biomes"
"Urban Decay"
These two are Environmental mods that add a ton of new decor to the game to make the world feel more organic.  
They're excellent, but are Resource Intensive!  
Do not use on older/weaker computers.  Even on a powerful PC, you might need to lower your settings. 

"Remove Buried Supplies Quests by GR": This mod removes T1-3 Buried Supplies Quests from possible Trader Quest selections. 
This does not remove the initial Special Quest "Introduction Buried Supplies" quest when you first meet the trader in a new game... other mods do that already.


Updated: 
"Cedar Creek" POI.
"Barricaded House" POI.  
"SG Militia" POI.
"Dwarven Citadel" POI.
"TheMeanOnes Paintings Pack x Expanded x 39 Paintings"
"CP Modded Core"
"CP Modded Traders Only"
"CBP"
"MPLogue's Prefabs"
