2.2.1.2 TBD

Reminder, the Smorgasbord ModList is currently on game version 2.2!

This update is mostly small fixes.

Standard warning: There's no gurantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!
