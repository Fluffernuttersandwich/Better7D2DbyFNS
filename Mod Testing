2.1.5.5 TBD

Comment:


Mods Removed: 

"Backup Mod" Kajdaniec reported it was broken. It was glitchy when I lst tested it, so pulling until it receives an update and can be reassessed. 

"GW71_NoMagazineXP" replaced with my own improved version.

Mods Added:

"TechFreq's Pouch Add-Ons to OCB's Pouch system." OP, mostly disabled.
I enabled the one for the wallet, because I like being able to store all Dukes in one slot. 
The others are disabled for: Medical, Ammo, and Minerals. Too OP for me. 

"No Exp from Reading" QoL, enabled.
You do not receive experience points for reading any book, magazines, or schematics. 
This includes modded versions so long as they used normal item name nomenclature. 
This mod was made for people who prefer slower progression to keep the game going longer.
This is a niche mod, but it's how I like to play. 
There's nothing wrong with double looting a Crack-a-Book POI, I don't mind the LBR system, but the double-dip makes leveling with reading too good.  

"The Walking Dead Avatar Pack UPDATED 2.1" VRoid, disabled, but already added to the Avatar folder.
New TWD Avatars added to VRoid.




Mods Updated:

"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS" 
StallionsDen provided me with some new Military Assets for the Disposable Heroes POI.  
Sincerely appreciated mate!
