2.0.3: 17:45

Comments: 

1. The ModList has been updated for 2.0b295 STABLE.  We are still on this version, because it's the latest Stbale version.    

2. Adjusted VRoid to remove the excessive number of not fully functional Avatars.  
As Avatars are updated to 2.x, I will reintroduce them. 
This should bring the storage requirement down, and I apologize for not considering the size implication.
I added a section to the ReadMe about Vroid if you want more information.  

Mods Removed: 
1. All NPC mods.  
These might come back at some point in the future of the list, but I spent too much time testing to remove some bugs, and I can't find them all.
It's not the fault of the NPC-Core mod, it's just too many other mods on the list are throwing compatibility issue when I add in NPC-Core.
If I had to choose other mods I like to play with personally, over NPC-Core, I will always choose the other mods on the list.  
Something on my list was causing unkillable vultures to spawn inside of POIs with NPCCore enabled.  
If one of you folks with more time than I have want to try to track it down, by all means please share your results.  

2. All of the mods that have not been updated for 2.x.  
All of the major Mod Authors have made the biggy updates that were easy fixes for 2.0.
Anything else could take substantially longer.
Most of the mods that have not been updated are for sound.  
Those actually are easy fixes, just a directory fix, but that's on them to fix their mods.  
Give them time.

3. "Thor" It was throwing too many errors.  I just don't have the time for nuanced troubleshooting right now.  
This one has always been a bit tempermental on this list, it might not be coming back.

4.  "OCB No Sudden Exit"
I expect this one to return when OCB Maurice updates the mod for v2.
