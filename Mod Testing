1.39: TBD

Comments: 
Small updates.


Removed: 
"Solar Powered"  It's redundant with Oakraven's mods, and was causing a compatibility issue with FHD.  

Added:
"Robotic Drone Headlamp Soft White" Standard Mod.  Changes Drone light mod from blue to white.  
"Fancy Home Decor - Add-On patch" Optional Decor Add-On patch to Fancy Home Decor.  
Now the lights don't need power, and you don't need to read the Wiring 101 magazines to unlock it.  
Allows you to loot some decor blocks and resuse them from POIs.  
If you turn these mods off mid-save, it can cause errors.

Updated: 
"EFT Extraction Pack"
"ZEFT_Extraction_No_Vanilla_Guns"
"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS" tweaks to existing POIs.
