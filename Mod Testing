1.26: TBD
Comments: 

Shucks howdy this is the biggest update I have ever done.

1. With EFT becoming massively popular, players kept asking me if it was compatible with my Mod List.  
It's not.  However, StallionsDen was working on EFT/Izy weapons compatability.  I helped him with playtesting balance and troubleshooting some problems.
Now we have his "EFT Extraction Pack" as a mod for the list if you are a gun nut.  It's nearly 6 Gb, so don't complain about the size, it is what it is.  
EFT weapons will water down the ammo, ammo ingredient, and weapon loot tables.  That can't be helped.  
After playtesting with it for a while, I noticed ammo production will be crucial, because you will never find your flavor of ammo in large quantities.  
So I also made a patch for Oakraven's Ammo Press to support Izy and the "EFT Extraction Pack".

2. I originally held off on adding Oakraven's stuff, because I wasn't sure if it would add loot bloat, cause errors, or uneccessarily complicate the game.  
Players kept asking, and I finally decided to try using them in the list.  They intuitively work in the game, no errors, and no loot bloat.  

3. The Descent.  This is a brand new and EXPERIMENTAL mod, but from the playtesting I have done so far, it works just fine.

4. UI Options: Some players absoloutely hate the CAT UI.  So, I gave them more options.  
They can now choose from four optional UI Suites: CAT UI, Steel UI, AGF HUD UI, or disable them all for the vanilla UI.  

Removed: 
"Reclaim Storage Crates", replaced with a better version.

Disabled: 
"Little Buddy" currently bugged, 'worked with LRS to give the author the fix.  Keeping in the list until the author updates their mod.
