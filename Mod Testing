1.35: TBD

Comments: 
Added a new Separator for Quests, since they have some extra comments for how they function... mostly as Mod Compatibility warnings.  

Removed: 
"MoreQuests" When combined with various other quests mods, it could sometimes cause compatibility issues.  
Replaced with a few other mods to achieve the same effect without the issues.    

Added:
"Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable"
"Traders Have More Quests"
"Reset Trader's Quests"


Updated: 
N/A
