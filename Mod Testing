1.33: TBD

Comments: 


Removed: 
"TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" switched over to one by LittleRedSonja, because it can do modded workstations.  

Added:
"Grab your stuff" Pick up crates, workstations, and special modded workstations like Oakraven's stuff.
Once again, LittleRedSonja was kind enough to extend the compatibility of her mod to support or Smorgasbord.
Please Endorse her mods and let her know you appreciate her work!  

Updated: 
"FNS Snow-to-H2O and Other Obvious Recipes" A user requested a funny recipe to render fat in a cooking pot for crafting torches.  
"The Descent" Fixed the last EFT mod compatibiltiy conflict.
