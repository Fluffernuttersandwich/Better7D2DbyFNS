2.2.6.1 TBD 31AUG2025 ?

Reminder, the Smorgasbord ModList is currently on the STABLE game version 2.2!

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Comments:

1. I tested SMX UI Suite. It sort of works for Smorgasbord, but I am deciding against inclduing it for now because it's a bit too buggy.
You can add it to your own game.
If someone here wanted to make a patch for it, I would include it, but not as it stands now. 
I actually prefer CATUI and SteelUI. And those rarely have issues with other mods. 

2. We are still on 2.2, and I expect when 2.3 goes Stable, it will break a lot of mods.  
So, when this happens, it might take me some time to update Smorgasbord. 
I will work on it as time permits, but remember, I can't move forward without the dependancy mods that support us.
I know things like Quartz, Gears, Score, and a bunch of mods that touch UI screens will need to be updated. 
I have at least a dozen more I know that will need to be updated so far.
