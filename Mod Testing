FNS Gratitude Shout Outs:

leopardtheboss: For offering his "Zombies eat gore" framework as opensource from his Descent mod.  I used it in my Bait Bag mod. 

Guppycur: For hosting the Discord server, and his kind words.  He's kept it going for a long time, and kept the community in a healthy state.

TFP: For addressing the community concerns to perform the needed course correction on Biome Progression. 
Not an easy decision I'm sure, but it was the right move.  

Mods Removed: 

The previous RWG and RWG-Trader mods.  Swapped back to the one from PGz, less headaches.  

Mods Added:

"IED Conversion Kit by FNS" Standard, enabled.
Convert different types of explosives into other kinds using a multitude of recipes at the Workbench.
You can use this mod in tandem with "Pick Up Mines", to then convert them to pipebombs which you can use in...

"FNS Bait Bags and Baited Mines" Standard, enabled.
Craft a Bait Bag to lure zombies away from you. Also, upgrade your Bait Bag with a Pipe Bomb for a lured mine.
If you haven't seen the video, you should!

"BdubsVehicles2VehicleMadness" Vehicles, enabled.
Use with both Bdubs Vehicles and Vehicle Madness. 
This mod makes Bdubs Vehicles spawn as repairable vehicles if using Vehicle Madness.
Ivern the Cruel did a great job with this one. Well done buddy.  

"OCB No Sudden Exit" Standard, enabled.
Adds a delay when exiting an aircraft, to buy you enough time to hit the Esc key to cancel.

"OCB Remote Turret Control CCTV (V2.0)"
Remote control station for using the sentry guns.

"NPCX Spider Colony" NPC Suite.
This mod has been nerfed since the previous edition which is a good thing.
The Queen Spiders are still not to be triffled with.  

"Fari's Lightsabers" OP, disabled.
Too OP, but fun.

"PGz Boosted Big Cities" POI/RWG, enabled.
This one is the less problematic RWG mod.  

"ZZZ Mechanic Tweaks" OP, enabled.
Mildly nerfs the Mechanic mod.

Mods Updated: 

"Modded CompoPack"

"OCB Parachute" Removed the benign error.

"Black Wolf's Better Explosives"

"Witos Camera"

"LittleRedSonja ZombiePack" 
From Sonja: I hope you brought bandages... now with Michael Myers.

"LittleRedSonja BarbieDavidson" 

"RuntimeOCD"

"EFTX Suite"
StallionsDen once again with about 9000 ChangeLog entries. You have to go to that mod page to read 'em all. 

"WalkerSim" 
Now the zombies have much better hearing! Stealth will be a priority, especially in the early game.
Zombie Population Density has been set to 180 in the WalkerSim.xml file. Adjust it to your own liking.  
WalkerSim and NPCCore are now more compatible with eachother. 
If playing with NPCCore, you should see fewer NPCs since WalkerSim will not be spawning them.
Makes for a less frantic experience.
