2.0.6: TBD

Standard warning: 
There are no guarantees updating the ModList will allow you to keep playing in an existing save.  
It's best practice to wait to update the ModList until you are ready to start a new playthrough.  
I have been able to continue my same playthrough, but YMMV.

Comments: 

The ModList is still on 2.0b295 STABLE.  We are still on this version, because it's the latest Stable version.    

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"Armor Racks" Adds an Armor Rack to display suits of armor.

"Better Lighting" This is one of two lighting options for the ModList. 
Choose this mod, or "World Lighting Tuned", but not both. 
Better Lighting adds a more natural Eye Light Adaption between sunny and shaded areas for more realistic lighting.
You can go to that NexusMods page and also download the ReShade manually and add it to your own game if you so choose.
I do not add/offer ReShades to this ModList.
I find the World Lighting Tuned to be darker, and less realistic, but I like it's deeper darkness and color saturation levels.  
Lighting purists will prefer Better Lighting's more realistic shadows and eyesight light-level acclimation.  

"Drone Weapons" Adds weapon mods available to the drone. 
You add the weapon mod to the drone itself, deploy the drone, add the specific drone-weapon-mod ammo to it's inventory, and can give the drone simple comboat orders with the Tab key radial menu. 
Just set it to 'fire at will'.
I like it, but for late game when you don't care about stealth.

Mods Updated: 
"VoltraLux POI Pack"
"CAT UI"
"Custom FPV FOV"
"The Descent"
"Torch"
