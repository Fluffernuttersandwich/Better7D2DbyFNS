1.37: TBD

Comments: 
Updates to the ModList are usually dependant on other mods with their own dependencies getting updated.  
When the main EFT Overhaul ModPack updated last week, StallionsDen needed time to update and test the EFT Extraction Pack.
Then every day over the last week, there were like a dozen new updates of mods on the list.
Then I needed a chance to update and test Smorgasbord with all of the new updates, so that is why this update took a little longer.
I was also holding out for a new update to Izy, but that might take a bit longer...

Big thanks to Kajdaniec for creating, testing, and proving this list can work on a Dedicated Server.  
See the ReadMe on the GitHub page for reference.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Network Timeout Extension" Framework mod.  
Assists in multiplayer and Dedicated Server connection issues.  

"Galaxy Far Far Away" Optional QoL mod.  
It adds an interesting nightscape that randomly changes every night.  You can manually set one you prefer in the files.  

"(V1) Firefighter Driving Skill" Optional OP mod: 
Increases the benefit of reading The Fireman's Almanac Vol 7 : Emergency Driving.

"WMM AirDrops Spawn Zeds" Standard Mod. Spawns zombies when you go to collect the air drops.  

"WMM Loot Respawn Tweak" Standard Mod.  
Small modlet that shows what day and time a container will respawn.  
I don't think this is working with this list, still testing functionality.  

"WMM Trader Quest Map" Standard Mod. 
When you first talk to the trader about jobs, it will pop-open a map screen on the left allowing you to choose from every job available in your vicinity.
Just reengage the Trader about jobs to reopen this map screen.  Yes, I am aware of a bit of UI-screen overlap, but it works and isn't a major problem.  

"Custom FPV FOV" You can change these settings in GEARS from within the game.  

"GEARS Settings Saver" Saves GEARS settings between new worlds/games.    

"Add-on to Black Wolf's Better Loot Spawns for EFT-Extraction and Izy guns" Optional OP mod
