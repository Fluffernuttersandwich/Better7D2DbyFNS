Testing for ModList version 1.5

Updated: FNS Special Requirements POI Pack to v1.20, includes the Christmas Day Massacre and updated rwgmixer file.
Swapped LittleRedSonja's Christmas pack for the lighter variant version.  


Future Plans:

I think Izy will be updating his AIO Gun Pack to 4.0 in the near future, so I will likely wait and test again with those.  

And Stallionsden will be adding a fun surprise in the CBP I plan to use soon!
