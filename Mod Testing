1.46: TBD

Comments: 

Regarding mods from Non-NexusMods offsite locations; I will use links to GitHub, and some to Google Drives (depending on their formatting).  
I am not going to use mods that go to ModDB because their site intermittently forces users to download manually.  

1. Hotfix update.  
A. Izy's Vanilla Replacer
B. Removed the Western NPC mod for two reasons.  It was throwing errors and it required users to manually manipulate it for installation from ModDB.
C. EFT Extraction Pack was fixed.  The Learn-by-Doing (LBD) system was removed.  I will now set the Extraction suite back to enabled in MO2 by default.  

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
Kajdaniec for helping me test the download process for the new offsite mods.  

Removed: 
"Western Entity Pack for NPC-Core"

Added:

"Guppy's Tin Can Grenade" Optional QoL mod.  
This mod does two things: 
1. Adds an empty tin can to the players inventory after consuming a canned food item. 
2. Adds a recipe that allows players to create small improvised (ghetto-rigged) Tin Can Grenades.
Throw it immediately or it will blow up in your hand.  

Updated: 

"Izy's Vanilla Replacer"
"EFT Extraction Pack"
