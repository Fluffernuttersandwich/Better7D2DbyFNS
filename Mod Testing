Comments:

Over the last several months I have been trying to improve the "default" mods enabled in Smorgasbord to make it a more balanced experience. 
With this latest update, I am trying to steer the "default" experience to be more intricate and challenging. 
When I say intricate, I don't mean unnecessarily confusing, I'd hate that. I'm aiming for pleasantly complex, while remaining intuitive.  
I want the player to have to manage more for a grittier game experience where decisions matter.
And I also love the random interruptions from mods like: Blood Moon Chaos, Better Storms, WalkerSim, and Random Zombie Movement.

I have changed the name of the catch-all separator to "Survivalist".
I also used a uniform phrase you can filter by in MO2 "Challenge Boosting Mod (CBM)!"
A CBM is anything that adds a layer of complexity, challenge, or thoughtful change to provide a more stimulating experience over vanilla.  
For a long time people have viewed Smorgasbord as just "whatever you want it to be" which it still can be depending on how you personalize your experience.
But, for a default experience, I really want to deliver something with character.
People hate bland play-it-safe games, they want a memorable experience.  

As you all have seen, A16 is all the rage right now. 
If I was to try and condense the main attractions of A16, I'd say this: Sophisticated players want a more engaging game.
2.0 vanilla is too dumbed down.  So how can Smorgasbord's default-as-delivered Mod List offer players what they really want?

1. Non-linear experience: People hate being railroaded to the same path every game.
With the mods I selected and modified, I have tried to offer the freedom players want without removing or completely overhauling existing systems. 

2. Intricacy: They want complexity without convolution. 
Survival games should not resolve all survival issues too early into a playthrough.
I really think the mods I've recently added and tweaked, will scratch that itch.
Better Storms, Immersive Survival, Medical Conditions, Insomnia. 


Mods Removed: 

N/A

Mods Added:

"Darks Soldierz" NPC, disabled.
Adds neutral/ally Soldiers.

"Darks Cleanerz" NPC, disabled.
Adds hostile Soldiers.

"Arrows And Bolts Cause Bleed" OP, enabled.
Vanilla Arrows and Bolts cause bleeds, if you take points in the Deep Cuts Perk.
I don't think it's too OP, I think it just helps keep archery relevant in the middle-to-late game.

"ProjectileBleedMod" OP, disabled.
Vanilla guns cause bleeds, if you take points in "Deep Cuts".
"IZY_Bleed_Patch" OP, disabled.
Vanilla and Izy guns cause bleeds, if you take points in "Deep Cuts".
Both of these were disabled by default because in my opinion, guns don't need a buff in Smorgasbord.

"IZPrebuilt's Improved Loot Experience" OP, enabled.
