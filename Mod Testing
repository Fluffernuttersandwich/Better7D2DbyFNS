1.47: TBD

Comments: 

You will need to start a new game with this update, because the EFT Extraction Pack (EFTX) received another major update.   
Some of the other mods might have received updates to their progression.xml file, so again, start a new save.
If you're not ready to start a new save, there's no pressure, just wait to update.  

FNS gratitude shout-outs:

StallionsDen for the tremendous effort he pours into EFTX.  

Removed: 

"TechFreqsBackToMainMenuMod" The author informed me it had a significant error issue depending on how it was used.  Removing for now.  

Added:

"Rodent Reducer add-on patch for Urban Decay" Optional, under graphics-performance separator, just to keep it near Urban Decay.  This reduces rat/bat spawns by 90%.  
"Crouching Doesnt Make The Screen Go Dark" Optional QoL, enabled by default. 
"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack02 VanillaReVamp" Decor/Armor.  
"(V1) Vehicle Mods Crafting Skill" Reading Vehicle Magazines unlocks vehicle-mods.  
"TheMeanOnes Interchangable Skies" Optional QoL.  I disabled "Galaxy..." and enabled this one to do the same thing.  Both are there, choose one.  
"TheMeanOnes Loot Indicators"
"LittleRedSonja Timber Inc Table Saw" Standard, enabled.  Adds a new Table Saw workstation where you can trade dukes for stacks of wood.  
"LittleRedSonja Normalized Craft Times" Optional QoL, disabled by default.  Balances crafting times... some are shorter, most are longer.
"LittleRedSonja Flying Fancy Magic Broom" Vehicle mod, enabled.  For those of you who want to fly around on a broom.  

"LittleRedSonja Shopping Time FULL version" Optional OP, disabled by default (because it's really OP).  
This mod adds a craftable "Online Shopping Terminal" that allows you to buy, 24/7, from a selection of rare, difficult to find or highly demanded items, such as solar cells, engines, learning elixirs, duct tape, candies and much much more.

"Additional Research - add-on patch" OP Optional, enabled. 
This is an add-on patch to the 'Research' mod. I made this to allow players to craft EFTX magazines from the Research Workstation.  
It also supports the Knife, Sledgehammer, and Tool Time Books. 


Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack" (new abbreviation is EFTX, it's what all the cool-kids are saying).
StallionsDen added a magazine series for each unique gun.  Not gun type, but each unique gun-model.  So, it's not just pistols, an M1911 has it's own magazine series, Glock17 has it's own, etc.        
What this means for you as a player:
1. You will now rarely find EFT guns, only after Game Stage 15, and you will only pull tier 1 quality EFTX-guns.  The emphasis has moved to crafting.  
2. You need to read 25 magazines of the same specific gun type to unlock the ability to craft that one gun at tier 1.  25 subsequent magazines need to be read for each additional crafting tier level.
3. Vanilla Cop, Soldier, and Nurse zombies are now lootable (if you play with EFTX).  This will likely be your best source of EFTX magazines.  I cannot stress this enough: Looting Cop and Soldier corpses is priority #1!!!
4. I strongly encourage you to play at 100% Loot Abundance with EFTX going forward to give yourself the best odds to pull those magazines.  
For Smorgasbord, I disabled the 'zombies despawn in 6 seconds' mod.  It's still there, but since most players will be playing with EFTX, I wanted to make sure they had adequate time to loot those specified zombies. 
Please keep an open mind to the chnages made, a lot of hard work went into this update.  
Some people might not like the changes, but this was done to lengthen your playthrough and make it feel like you earned it when you get an EFT gun.  Finding tier 6 doom-cannons on day 1 was broken, way too OP.
I like the direction EFTX is going.  In time, StallionsDen will play with the balance.  He's open to constructive criticism, but please don't whinge! 
If you have any constructive criticism, please share it on the Nexus comments forum for the mod, or over at his eft-guns-only channel at Guppy's Discord Server. 
Yes, trying to get 25 magazines of one gun-model may take you weeks in-game.
Knowing my player base fairly well, I made the "Additional Research" mod, as an option in Smorgasbord to help you get your preffered gun a little bit faster.

"Research" I changed the variant from Hardcore to Default to support users playing with EFTX.  Makes it slightly cheaper/faster.
