2.2.4.1 20:00 EST 20AUG2025

Reminder, the Smorgasbord ModList is currently on the STABLE game version 2.2!

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Mods Removed: 

"Little Buddy" The Mod Author pulled it. 

Mods Added:

"Random Zombie Speed" Zombie, enabled.
Zombies have a random speed rating regardless of your game speed setting. 
I did reduce the top speed, because the author set it past Nightmare+ speed.
It was too janky and unpleasant. 
After reducing their top speed, it's much nicer!  

"Oak's Bandit Head Hunters" NPC, disabled.
Adds new Bandit Head Hunters.
Unlike the Zombie Head Hunters, these are balanced as is.

"MXMRMXS POI Pack" POI, enabled.
He's a new prefabber. I like to encourage the development of other prefabbers as the old salts did that for me.
Some of the POIs are not as balanced as you might hope for, but not bad. He's new, balance will come with time.
What I like is that he's innovating, and trying some new ideas.  We need more of that daring in POI design.  

Mods Updated:

"Undo Block Placement"
"Baron Wildpig Castle"
"Singularity"
"Runtime OCD"
"7 Days of Insomnia"
"XFX"
"Armor Rack"
"TMO Zombies Can't Dig"
"Fari's Lightsaber"
"Halicopter"
