1.46: TBD

Comments: 

1. Hotfix update.  
A. Izy's Vanilla Replacer
B. Removed the Western NPC mod because it required users to manually manipulate it for installation.

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
Kajdaniec for helping me test the download process for the new offsite mods.  

Removed: 
"Western Entity Pack for NPC-Core". I don't want to include mods that require users to manually drag them into the list.   

Added:

"Guppy's Tin Can Grenade"  

Updated: 

"Izy's Vanilla Replacer"
