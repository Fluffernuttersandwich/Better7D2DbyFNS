2.3.1.3 10:30 EST 14SEP2025

For Game version 2.3

Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough. 
Don't FOMO! The list isn't going anywhere!

Comments:

1. Hot fix, small update on a few mods.

2. POI Errors loading into a newly generated world: Most likely a "Descent" issue

In previous versions, most of the time, Descent could generate a map larger than 10k.
However, now in 2.3, it fails more often than not.  
It has intermittent issues!
Sometimes it will Error and hang, and you need to exit the game.
Sometimes it can "stealth fail" where the map generates, doesn't pop-open the Console showing that The Descent failed to run, 
but still spit you out a map that when you go to launch your game, it's riddled with POI errors.
For now, if using The Descent to perform Advanced RWG, stick to maps lower than 10k.
If you want to try for larger maps, run RWG with the Console open, and be prepared for it to take multiple attempts.  
Or, just use my default maps, they all have Descent, even the 12k and 13k
