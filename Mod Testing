Comments: 

1. With EFT becoming massively popular, players kept asking me if it was compatible with my Mod List.  
It's not.  However, StallionsDen was working on EFT/Izy weapons compatability.  I helped him play test balance and troubleshooting some problems.
Now we have his EFT Extraction Pack as a mod for the list if you are a gun nut.  It's nearly 6 Gb, so don't complain, it is what it is.  
EFT weapons will water down the ammo, ammo ingredient, and weapon loot tables.  
After playtesting with it for a while, I noticed ammo production will be crucial, because you will never find your flavor of ammo in large quantities.  
Because of that, I am worked on expanding Oakraven's Ammo Press workstation to support Izy and EFT ammo.

2. I originally held off on adding Oakraven's stuff, because I wasn't sure if it would add loot bloat, or uneccessarily complicate the game.  
Players kept asking, and I finally decided to try using them in the list.  They intuitively work in the game, and no loot bloat.

Future Plans:
Working with Donovan to see about fine tuning a Load Order solution for MO2/Wabbajack.  
Working with StallionsDen on a compatibility match between Izy's AIO and the EscapeFromTarkov gun pack.
