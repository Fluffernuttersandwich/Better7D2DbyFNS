1.33: TBD

Comments: 
Just some fine tuning with this update.  I am actually going to begin a playthrough on my own list, and record some videos.  

Removed: 
"TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" switched over to one by LittleRedSonja, because it can do modded workstations.  

Added:
"Grab your stuff" Pick up crates, workstations, and special modded workstations like Oakraven's stuff.
Once again, LittleRedSonja was kind enough to extend the compatibility of her mod to support our Smorgasbord.
Please Endorse her mods and let her know you appreciate her work!  

Updated: 
"FNS Snow-to-H2O and Other Obvious Recipes" A user requested a funny recipe to render fat in a cooking pot for crafting torches.  
"The Descent" Fixed (hopefully) the last EFT mod compatibiltiy conflict.  
"EFT Extraction Pack" fixed some minor bugs, added in RPGs!  They wreck stuff like dev-grenades!  
"OCB Crooked Deco" Makes things like trees slightly askew, so it provides more unique looks, so more organic world.
"OCB Startup Optimizer" Boy was I sleeping on this mod, much faster load times!
"OCB Remote Description" Requirement mod for "OCB Plant Grow Info"
"OCB Plant Grow Info" Plants and trees display remaining growth time.

Future Plans:
Working with Donovan to see about fine tuning a Load Order solution for MO2/Wabbajack.
