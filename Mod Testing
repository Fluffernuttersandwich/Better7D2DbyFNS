2.1.2.3 TBD

This ModList works with game version 2.1b9.  

Reminder: Adding your own mods to this ModList voids the warranty on getting assitance from FNS.  
I will work to reduce/eliminate issues in the list I provide you, but I cannot help you when you make your own additions.
It's not that I don't want to help you, it's just my time is limited.  When you add stuff, you are on your own!

Mods Removed: 
N/A

Mods Added:

"Wasteland Cuisine"

Mods Updated: 

"GNS Beautiful Bases"
"Alternative Biome Progression"
"Tool Time" 
"Witos Camera"
"NPCCore Suite"
"VRoid" Added new Avatars.

Mod Status change:

I Broke "NPCCore" into sub-component mods. So, if you want to play with normal NPCs, but not robots, you can disable robots individually.

"Descent" I did just figure something out.  I was getting some lighting flickering at night outside.  
It was Descen't cave-lights folder.  The author told me I could safely remove it.  I am removing it going forward.
