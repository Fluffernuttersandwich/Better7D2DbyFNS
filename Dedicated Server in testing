Dedicated Server in testing

Community member Kajdaniec set up a dedicated server using this ModList.  I connected to it accross the world, and it was running very well with no latency issues on either of our ends.
He has it's name and password listed in my Discord Server if you want to play with him.  

I will work with him on providing instructions for converting this list into a dedicated server for others in the near future.

Down the road, I might offer the list from a Dedicated Server provider like Havoc.
