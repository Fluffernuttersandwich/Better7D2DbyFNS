Hotfix for EFTX and a few other small mods.  
I was able to update EFTX from 1.4.0.5 to 1.4.0.6 and continue playing in the same save. 
I was able to go from Smorgasbord v1.47 to 1.48 in the same save.  
It's always recommended to start a new game when you update this list, but you could make a backup and try.  
It worked for me. 

FNS gratitude shout-outs:

Once again, to StallionsDen for the improvement and quick fixes to EFTX.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Zombie Hunter Scifi Minimap"
"Zombie Hunter Scifi Minimap - Visible Enemy Dots"
These are both UI Mods, they're optional, and disabled by default. 
This mod adds a Sci-Fi themed Minimap to the bottom right corner of the screen.  
One version shows enemy dots on the minimap, the other doesn't.
Animal mobs (both hostile and prey types) do not show up as dots on the minimap.
You can play with the minimap settings under the GEARS "Mods" section in the Game's Menu Options.
GEARS Mods > Quartz > Minimap tab.  
The minimap has an overlap with the Steel-UI 15-slot toolbelt.  
You can live with it, use a different UI, disable the 15-Slot toolbelt, or use the Immersive Toolbelt mod so it's less of an issue. 
I actually tried both the Zombie Hunter and Scifi UI mods, but neither worked.  So, all we get is this optional Scifi minimap for now.

Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack suite"
"Ammo Press Add-On Patch for EFT and Izy" Minor mispelling in xml, my bad.  
"Rodent Reducer" I added an additional remover xml file because they kept spawning in some calls.

Comments: 
You will need to start a new game with this update, because the EFT Extraction Pack (EFTX) received another major update.   
Some of the other mods might have received updates to their progression.xml file, so again, start a new save.
If you're not ready to start a new save, there's no pressure, just wait to update the ModList.  

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
StallionsDen for the tremendous effort he pours into EFTX.  

Removed: 
"TechFreqsBackToMainMenuMod" The author informed me it had a significant error issue depending on how it was used.  Removing for now.  

Added:

"Rodent Reducer add-on patch for Urban Decay" Optional, under graphics-performance separator, just to keep it near Urban Decay.  This removes rat/bat spawns by entirely from global random spawning.  
"Crouching Doesnt Make The Screen Go Dark" Optional QoL, enabled by default.  It disables that vignette dark border at the edge of the screen when you crouch.   
"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack02 VanillaReVamp" Decor/Armor.  
"(V1) Vehicle Mods Crafting Skill" Reading Vehicle Magazines unlocks vehicle-mods.  
"TheMeanOnes Interchangable Skies" Optional QoL.  I disabled "Galaxy..." and enabled this one to do the same thing.  Both are there, choose one.  
"TheMeanOnes Loot Indicators"
"LittleRedSonja Timber Inc Table Saw" Standard, enabled.  Adds a new Table Saw workstation where you can trade dukes for stacks of wood.  
"LittleRedSonja Normalized Craft Times" Optional QoL, disabled by default.  Balances crafting times... some are shorter, most are longer.
"LittleRedSonja Flying Fancy Magic Broom" Vehicle mod, enabled.  For those of you who want to fly around on a broom.  

"LittleRedSonja Shopping Time FULL version" Optional OP, disabled by default (because it's pretty OP).  
This mod adds a craftable "Online Shopping Terminal" that allows you to buy, 24/7, from a selection of rare, difficult to find or highly demanded items, such as solar cells, engines, learning elixirs, duct tape, candies and much much more.

"Additional Research - add-on patch" OP Optional, enabled. 
This is an add-on patch to the 'Research' mod. I made this to allow players to craft EFTX magazines from the Research Workstation.  
It also supports the Knife, Sledgehammer, and Tool Time Books. 


Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack" (new abbreviation is EFTX, it's what all the cool-kids are calling it).
Learn-by-reading (LbR) System update: EFTX-Core-Standard
There are new EFTX magazine series.   
What this means for you as a player:
1. You will now rarely find EFTX guns, only after Game Stage 15, and you will only pull tier 1 quality EFTX-guns. 
The emphasis of this mod has moved to crafting to get superior versions.
2. You can find tier 1 EFTX guns in these loot containers: toilets, military trucks, police cars, and gun safes. 
3. You need to read between 10 and 25 (depending on the weapon) related magazines to unlock the ability to craft it. 
Then you need to continue reading more magazines for additional crafting tier levels.
4. Vanilla Cop, Soldier, Mutants, and Nurse zombie corpses are now lootable. 
This will likely be your best source of EFTX magazines. 
They also have a small chance of dropping tier 1 EFTX guns. 
I cannot stress this enough: Looting Vanilla Cop, Soldier, and Mutant corpses is priority #1!!!
5. Ammo Piles are another great place to find EFTX Skill Magazines.  
6. I strongly encourage you to play at 100% Loot Abundance with EFTX going forward to give yourself the best odds to pull those new EFTX skill magazines.  
Please keep an open mind to the recent changes made to this mod, a lot of hard work went into this update.
Some people might not like all of the changes, but this was done to lengthen your playthrough and make it feel like you earned it when you get a higher tier EFT gun. 
Finding tier 6 doom-cannons on day 1 was broken, way too OP.
StallionsDen is open to constructive criticism, but please don't whinge!   
If you have any constructive criticism, please share it on the Nexus comments forum, or over at the #eft-only-guns channel at Guppy's Discord Server. 
For Smorgasbord, I disabled the 'zombies despawn in 6 seconds' mod.  It's still there, but since most players will be playing with EFTX, I wanted to make sure they had adequate time to loot those specified zombies. 
Knowing my player base fairly well, I made the "Additional Research" mod, as an option in Smorgasbord to help you get your preferred gun a little bit faster.

"Research" I changed the variant from Hardcore to Default to support users playing with EFTX.  Makes it slightly cheaper/faster.

Comments: 

Regarding mods from Non-NexusMods offsite locations; I will use offsite mods if they link to GitHub/GitLab locations.  
I am not going to use mods that go to ModDB/G-Drives because they force users to download and install the mods manually.  

A. Izy's Vanilla Replacer.  Izy added a few small fixes.

B. Removed the Western NPC mod for two reasons.  
It was throwing errors and it required users to manually manipulate it for installation from ModDB.
I have alerted the Mod Author, so it might be updated and return at some point in the future.  

C. EFT Extraction Pack was fixed.  
The Learn-by-Doing (LBD) system was removed.  
I have now set the Extraction suite back to enabled in MO2 by default.

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
Kajdaniec for helping me test the download process for the new offsite mods.  
StallionsDen for working so hard on the EFT Extraction Pack revision.  

Removed: 
"Western Entity Pack for NPC-Core"

Added:

"Guppy's Tin Can Grenade" Optional QoL mod.  
This mod does two things: 
1. Adds an empty tin can to the players inventory after consuming a canned food item. 
2. Adds a recipe that allows players to create small improvised (ghetto-rigged) Tin Can Grenades.
Throw it immediately or it will blow up in your hand.  

"Guppy's Motorized Shopping Cart" From LittleRedSonja, we ressurected a fun vehicle Guppy made years ago. 

"Better Pipe Guns" Optional OP Mod.  Increases the damage of the Pipe Rifle and Pipe Shotgun slightly, just to make them less useless.  

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy's DangerGirl ArmorPack01" Adds some new armor for the ladies.  

"IncreasedStackSize" mods of various sizes.  

"Thor Thunderstorm Mod" Optional, Graphic/Environmental.  
This is set to disabled by default, it can be resource intensive on some systems, but the latest update is working fine for me.

"Games Settings Extender" Optional QoL.  Do not go too far in either extreme for some of the game options or you could have upredictable results. 

"ChainMining" Optional OP Mod.  This is the VeinMining mod from Minecraft.  
If you mine one ore type with a mining tool, you will mine all of the conncted ore of the same type.

"QuickStop" Optional OP Mod.  Aim improves when you come to a full stop like in other FPS games.  

Updated: 

"Izy's Vanilla Replacer"
"EFT Extraction Pack"
"Oakraven's Balloons"
"TMO Trader Never Closes"
"WalkerSim"

Warning: Do not update this ModList until you are ready to start a new game!
This is a major ModList update!  
This update will very likely break your existing save.  
You've been warned!

Comments: 

1. This is the NPC Update many of you have been asking for.  
It was a farily large undertaking adding this stuff to the list and testing as much as I reasonably could (as one man with limited time).
I have noticed the Gears setting button is not in the Settings options currently, not sure if it's from the NPC Core addition, or another mod causing it to not show up... 
Gears is still applying but the button is not displaying... if anyone could help me figure this out, I'd appreciate it.  

2. EFT Extraction Pack received a major update.  
I have said it before, but have to say it again for new people: EFT Extraction Pack follows behind the EFT Overhaul modpack.  
This past week the EFT Overhaul modpack radically changed progression.  
They now use a Learn-By-Doing (LBD) System.  The EFT Overhaul did this for balance. Extraction Pack copied this to be inline with their changes.
What this means for users: 
A. You will miss something like 50% of your shots, even at point blank "impossible to miss" range until you level up.
B. Extremely sluggish aiming animation until you level up.
StallionsDen is planning an alternative, to offer a separate option that doesn't use the EFT Overhaul's Learn-By-Doing system.  
Please be patient, it wil take him some time to create a deviation.
Until that option becomes available, I am setting the EFT Extraction Suite mods to disabled on this ModList for the time being.  
They're there if you want to use them, but I know the majority of my player base will have mixed reactions to the current system.
If you don't like the change, keep it disabled for now, and just use Izy's for now...

3. For the first time, I have added Non-NexusMods "offsite" mods to the list.  
They should all still be one-click.  I purposefully avoided any mods that required users to manually manipulate.  
My secondary computer is on the fritz, so I cannot currently test the download process from the user perspective.  
You guys are my guinea pigs, if something didn't download right, please let me know.  
Fingers crossed, I set everything up correctly, and it should all work out alright... should, should. :)

Notice:
1. I start a new job next week so will not have as much time to devote to modding/troubleshooting.  Expect slower response times going forward.   
2. Izy is working on his AIO v5.0 update, hopefully releasing in a few weeks.   

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
Grey.  He is working on providing the community with directions for converting this list to Linux Nobara.

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

NPC Separator and all mods therein.
You might notice a few missing NPC mods you see on other listings.  This is because the links were dead, or required manual manipulation, and I won't add those.
There are a few more NPC mods I tried, but were throwing errors so just skipped those for now.  I'll check them again in future updates.
I disabled all NPC mods by default, because they really do change the game drastically.  
Being shot at constantly, or seeing random giant spiders, or dinosaurs rubs some people the wrong way.
If you use NPC Mods, go into the in-game NPC Settings, and hit the checkbox to mute NPC Follower footstep sound effects... they'll drive you crazy if you don't.

"Guppy's Zombies": Zombie Spawning, Optional mod, adds zombie variety.
"KHZmusik Zombies": Zombie Spawning, Optional mod, adds zombie variety.

"WalkerSim" Zombie Spawning, Optional mod.  This replaces the normal Wandering Horde mechanic.  
I set this mod to enabled.  I'd like to hear some feedback from you folks on how you feel about it.
Zombies will be present as soon as you spawn in to a new world.  
This mod changes random global zombie spawning, so it is more uniquely organic.
This mod is set to default settings, but you can manually play with settings... see NexusMods page for details.  
The WalkerSim mod replaces wandering hordes which are spawned at random with a more complex simulation taking advantage of the entire map. 
The simulation will spawn the zombies when a player gets close and if the player is too far it will put them back into the simulation.  
This mod makes the "Wandering Horde Lootbags" and "Beefy Hordes" mods irrelevant.
Zombies will start spawning as soon as you enter the world.  
You will see daylight ferals in the forest biome on day one.  
I like this mod and think you should give it a fair try before disabling it.  

"Izy's Vanilla Replacer": OP mods, Optional.  Izy added an Optional mod called the Vanilla Replacer.  
This add-on mod replaces vanilla gun models, their animations, and sounds with new versions by Izayo. 
It also adds a kick-attack. Press the flashlight key to use. 
By default this is the F-key on a keyboard, or the D-pad Up button on an Xbox gamepad.  
The kick-function will only work on the vanilla-replaced guns.  Not Izy's other guns, nor EFT, etc.  

Updated: 

"LittleRedSonja Fancy Decor"
"Efficient Base Repair"
"EFT Extraction Pack" suite.
"Izy AIO Weapons Pack"

Comments: 
Users had a problem with Flogi's Perks Mod.  
It was updated so this revision of the Smorgasbord Modlist to 1.44 is mostly as a hotfix to that issue.  
While I was at it, I updated a few others... 

Notice:
EFT Extraction Pack and Izy are both planning an update in the near future, so the next update to Smorgasbord could be in the next few days. 

FNS gratitude shout-outs:
EyeOfWolf for reporting the issue with Flogi's Perk Mod.

Removed: 

Two of the OakravenAmmoPress-CompatibilityAddOn patches (because they were consolidated under one new file).  

Added:

"RWG POI Blocker" 
Optional POI mod, set to Disabled by default in MO2.  
Manual modification is required!  
Prevents user specified vanilla POIs from appearing on maps created by the vanilla RWG.  
By default it is set to block a few strip club POIs from spawning, but can easily be customized with your own list of POIs.  
Some users might want to use this mod to blacklist POIs like modded traders.

"(V1)-OakravenAmmoPress-CompatibilityAddOn"
Optional OP Mod... this was a consolodation of two other mods into one file.  

Updated: 

"Flogi's Perk Mod"
"Flogi's Quest Mod"
"World Tower"
"LittleRedSonja Ammunition Recycling"
"(V1)-OakravenAmmoPress-CompatibilityAddOn"

1.43: 17:15 EST 11APR2025

Comments: 
The Smorgasbord ModList v1.43 is now compatible with 7DtD game version 1.4b8.
The new 1.4b8 stable version mostly fixed bugs, and did not add/subtract any features.
I did see some minor UI errors, 
but they didn't pop-open the console mid-game and I didn't see any game-breaking errors.  
I tested it for a few hours and didn't notice any other major problems.  
It's impossible for my testing to be exhaustive, so if you notice any new unreported issues,
please let me know so I can fix things.  

On a personal note: I will be starting a new job in two weeks, and will have less time support this modding.  
I will still be updating it, but my update frequency and responsiveness to troubleshoot will be slower.

Yes, we are still on STABLE version 1.3b9.  We will not move to 1.4b8 until it becomes stable and is tested.

1.39: 00:20 EST 30MAR2025

Comments: 

You can call this the Perks, Sounds, and Cars update.  

1. I added a new separator in MO2 for Optional OP Perks.  Either use "Legend Perks" or "Flogi's Perk..." NOT BOTH!!!  "Natural Progression" can be used with either.

2. Added an Optional Sound Mods separator. 

3. I also added a new Cars separator.  The people asked for more cool cars, so more cars it is.  
The new Luxury cars are set to default Metallic color.  
If you don't like that color, you can manually reinstall those individual mods on your own MO2 yourself.  
Only choose one color or the mod won't work!!!

4. I added a section to the ReadMe about using Lossless Scaling to improve 7DtD performance.  
It allows me to run Ultra on this ModList with smoother graphics, and less stutters.  
It's a bit of a process to set up, but worth it if you want to get the most out of your game.  
It's very Hardware specific.  Kajdaniec and I have different profiles, I posted both.  


As always, I'd like to express my gratitude to people who comment, troubleshoot, and provide feedback.
This week's shout-outs: 
Kajdaniec for being our "unnofficial" tester!  We did a lot of LS testing this week with great results!
Cinnaspice for finding an issue with Plant Collection Challenges.  It's been reported to the Mod Author, still a WiP.  
NobodyNobody666 for the Flogi's Perk suggestion.
CarnaeAssada for helping us identify a Mod Compatibility issue with Solar Powered.  
LittleRedSonja for assisting in chasing down the Solar Powered issue.  


Removed: 

"Solar Powered"  It's redundant with Oakraven's mods, and was causing a compatibility issue with FHD.  

Added:

"Robotic Drone Headlamp Soft White" Standard Mod.  Changes Drone light mod from blue to white.

"PGz Boosted Big Cities" POI/RWG mod. Increases city sizes and allows them to spawn in all biomes.  This is redundant if you play with the CompoPack.  

"(V1) Quests Per Tier - 20" For people who want to slow down their game!
Instead of 10 quests per quest tier level, this mod makes you complete 20 quests slowing down your progression to keep the game going longer.  

"Flogi's Perk Mod" Optional OP, 
"Flogi's Perk Mod XP HUD" Optional OP, 

"Fancy Home Decor - Add-On patch" Optional Decor Add-On patch to Fancy Home Decor.  
Now the lights don't need power, and you don't need to read the Wiring 101 magazines to unlock it.  
Allows you to loot some decor blocks and resuse them from POIs.  
If you turn these mods off mid-save, it can cause errors.

"St. Mary's Hospital" Epic POI mod.  

Sound mods and Vehicles stuff, see the new separators, too many mods to list, I'm tired of typing.


Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack"
"ZEFT_Extraction_No_Vanilla_Guns"
"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS" tweaks to existing POIs.  
"Vault Pack for Descent"
"Danzo All Text With Shadow"
"Despawn Zombies Mod Optimize Zombie Despawning"
"...Pickup Crops"

Comments: 
Updates to the ModList are usually dependant on other mods with their own dependencies getting updated.  
When the main EFT Overhaul ModPack updated last week, StallionsDen needed time to update and test the EFT Extraction Pack.
Then every day over the last week, there were like a dozen new updates of mods on the list.
Then I needed a chance to update and test Smorgasbord with all of the new updates, so that is why this update took a little longer.
I was also holding out for a new update to Izy, but that might take a bit longer...

Big thanks to Kajdaniec for creating, testing, and proving this list can work on a Dedicated Server.  
See the ReadMe on the GitHub page for reference.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Network Timeout Extension" Framework mod.  
Assists in multiplayer and Dedicated Server connection issues.  

"Galaxy Far Far Away" Optional QoL mod.  
It adds an interesting nightscape that randomly changes every night.  You can manually set one you prefer in the files.  

"(V1) Firefighter Driving Skill" Optional OP mod: 
Increases the benefit of reading The Fireman's Almanac Vol 7 : Emergency Driving.

"WMM AirDrops Spawn Zeds" Standard Mod. Spawns zombies when you go to collect the air drops.  

"WMM Loot Respawn Tweak" Standard Mod.  
Small modlet that shows what day and time a container will respawn.  
I don't think this is working with this list, still testing functionality.  

"WMM Trader Quest Map" Standard Mod. 
When you first talk to the trader about jobs, it will pop-open a map screen on the left allowing you to choose from every job available in your vicinity.
Just reengage the Trader about jobs to reopen this map screen.  Yes, I am aware of a bit of UI-screen overlap, but it works and isn't a major problem.  

"Custom FPV FOV" You can change these settings in GEARS from within the game.  

"GEARS Settings Saver" Saves GEARS settings between new worlds/games.    

"Add-on to Black Wolf's Better Loot Spawns for EFT-Extraction and Izy guns" Optional OP mod

Updated: 

"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS"
"RWG Mixer for Smorgasbord"

Comments: 
Be mindful of the two new Environmental mods as they are Resource Intensive and could drag your performance down.  

New Separator:"Zombie Spawning Options"
After feedback from users and my own testing, I think Beefy Hordes by GR is adding in more zombies to the regular world zombies spawning.
Some players were saying it was making the game a bit too hard.  

Removed: 
"Must Load Last..." Separator.  I repurposed it, the original was unecessary, and confused users.  

Added:
"Advanced Junkyard" POI.
"SuperMax Prison" POI.
"Secret Base" POI.
"Koame's Turret Buffs": Extend turret activation range and by default you can have 3 turrets active.
"Additional Auger Blades": These tool-mods give the Auger longer/wider reach when mining to increase efficiency.
"More Armor Plates": Adds more armor-mods.
"Bump Stock": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Double Drum Magazine": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Fari's Pulse Rifle": Adds the M41A Pulse Rifle from the Aliens franchise...I'll likely add this to the Hadley's Hope POI.

"Better Biomes"
"Urban Decay"
These two are Environmental mods that add a ton of new decor to the game to make the world feel more organic.  
They're excellent, but are Resource Intensive!  
Do not use on older/weaker computers.  Even on a powerful PC, you might need to lower your settings. 

"Remove Buried Supplies Quests by GR": This mod removes T1-3 Buried Supplies Quests from possible Trader Quest selections. 
This does not remove the initial Special Quest "Introduction Buried Supplies" quest when you first meet the trader in a new game... other mods do that already.


Updated: 
"Cedar Creek" POI.
"Barricaded House" POI.  
"SG Militia" POI.
"Dwarven Citadel" POI.
"TheMeanOnes Paintings Pack x Expanded x 39 Paintings"
"CP Modded Core"
"CP Modded Traders Only"
"CBP"
"MPLogue's Prefabs"

Comments: 
Added a new Separator for Quests, since they have some extra comments for how they function... mostly as Mod Compatibility warnings.  

Removed: 
"MoreQuests" When combined with various other quests mods, it could sometimes cause compatibility issues.  
Replaced with a few other mods to achieve the same effect without the issues.    

Added:
"Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable"
"Traders Have More Quests"
"Reset Trader's Quests"
"(A21 and 1.0) Black Wolf's controls improvements for helicopters and planes": 
EXPERIMENTAL: I'm not entirely sure this mod is working, could users please let me know on Discord/GitHub? 
Installing this mod was problematic, because of how the folders were subdivided. 
I think I got it to take, but I want users to confirm this installation worked for them.

Rebranded the ModList, it took me a little bit to figure out how to change the name, and pictures.

1.28: 21:25 EST 21FEB2025

Comments: 

1. Added an optional sleeping system mod: "7 Days of Insomnia". If you don't want to play with it, that's fine, again, it's optional!   

2. Shuffled some mods around on the list to better categorize them.  

3. Using "TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" mod, it doesn't currently work on the modded-oakraven workstations, only vanilla workstations.  
I might make a patch add-on for this...

4. Because we are the primary guinea pigs for the EFT Extraction Pack, if you notice a balance issue, please let me or StallionsDen know.
Example: We might pull the surgical kit in a future update... it doesn't function like it does in the EFT Overhaul, is worth too much money, and is too common to find.  

Removed: 
"More Shots" Causing an issue breaking progression for other mods.  
"Falcons Bike changes" Causing an issue breaking progression for other mods.  Sad to see this one go, but not worth the knots it tied everything up in.  
"Sleep Unitl Dawn", replaced by Insomnia.
"Jakmeister999's REASONABLE Large Stacks (V1.0)" replaced with "Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"
"REASONABLE Large Stacks for IZY AIO" replaced with "Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"

Added:
New Separator for Decor Mods.
New Separator for Insomnia Suite.
"RuntimeOCD" to help troubleshoot errors.  Please keep this one if you send me logs to troubleshoot for you!    
"7 Days of Insomnia" Sleep system.
"Dewtas Car Respawner"
"Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"
"Craftable Helmet Attribute Mods"
"DoubleBlundy's Bounty Quests" Minor mod compatibility note: This does not work with the "MoreQuests" mod.  
You cannot do these jobs until you have returned others to the traders... limited simultaneous jobs.

Updated: 
"Modded CompoPack"
"EFT Extraction Pack"
"The Descent" fixed the EFT lighting bug, and other lighting issues.
"Mega Pack I" for The Descent.  
"LittleRedSonja Ammunition Recycling".  
"OPTIONAL ADD-ON Custom Ammo Bench by LittleRedSonja"
LittleRedSonja kindly added compatibility to our EFT Extraction Pack, and Oakraven Ammo Press add-ons!  
She's wonderful!  Please thank her if you appreciate what she does for our community!

Comments: 
Shucks howdy this is the biggest update I have ever done.

1. With EFT becoming massively popular, players kept asking me if it was compatible with my Mod List.  
It's not.  However, StallionsDen was working on EFT/Izy weapons compatibility.  I helped him with playtesting balance and troubleshooting some problems.
Now we have his "EFT Extraction Pack" as a mod for the list if you are a gun nut.  It's nearly 6 Gb, so don't complain about the size, it is what it is.  
EFT weapons will water down the ammo, ammo ingredient, and weapon loot tables.  That can't be helped.  
After playtesting with it for a while, I noticed ammo production will be crucial, because you will never find your flavor of ammo in large quantities.  
So I also made a patch for Oakraven's Ammo Press to support Izy and the "EFT Extraction Pack".

2. I originally held off on adding Oakraven's stuff, because I wasn't sure if it would add loot bloat, cause errors, or unnecessarily complicate the game.  
Players kept asking, and I finally decided to try using them in the list.  They intuitively work in the game, no errors, and no loot bloat.  

3. The Descent.  This is a brand new and EXPERIMENTAL mod, but from the playtesting I have done so far, it works just fine.
This Mod is Experimental!  
The Descent adds time to RWG and loading into the world.
Currently Descent has some lighting issues that will be resolved in the next update, within a week or so.  
Known issue: If you play with both the Descent and the EFT Extraction Pack, you cannot run or jump while a player light-source is on.  
I reported the bug to the author, he will patch it in a week or so.  

4. UI Options: Some players absolutely hate the CAT UI.  So, I gave them more options.  
They can now choose from four optional UI Suites: CAT UI, Steel UI, AGF HUD UI, or disable them all for the vanilla UI.

Removed: 
"Reclaim Storage Crates", replaced with a better version.

Disabled: 
"Little Buddy" currently bugged, 'worked with LRS to give the author the fix.  Keeping in the list until the author updates their mod.  

Added:
New Separator for UI Options
"Steel UI HUD" Optional UI suite.
"AGF HUD UI" Optional UI suite.
"EFT Extraction Pack" Adds the weapons, ammo, mods, injectables, first aid, and all of the ingredient components to craft them from the popular Escape from Tarkov Overhaul mod. 
"Oakraven Rock Drill" Auto-resource mining workstation.  
"Oakraven Cooking Stations" Aesthetic variant cooking workstations.
"Oakraven Cement Mixer" More efficient cement mixing.
"Oakraven Power Things" Superior late game power generation systems.  
"Oakraven Fish Farm" Adds a fish farm workstation to the game.
"Oakraven Bee Hives" Adds new workstations for honey production.
"Oakraven Balloons" Hot Air Balloons as a means of conveyance.  
"Oakraven Forges" Aesthetic variant forge workstations.
"Oakraven Walkways" Adds 'accordian' bridges
"Oakraven Self-Seed Farming" Harvestable plants in Farm Plots will self-plant instead of seed-drop.  
"Oakraven Chicken Coops" Adds a chicken coop workstation.  
"Oakraven Ammo Press" Adds an Ammo Press workstation for more efficient ammo production.  
"Ammo Press Add-On Compatibility Patch for EFT" for EFT ammo.
"Ammo Press Add-On Compatibility Patch for Izy" for Izy ammo.
"Natural Progression" Learn by doing experience system stacked on top of the learn by reading system.  
"World Ready Chime" plays a sound to let you know your game is ready to play at the spawn screen.  
"The Descent" This mod is an extension of the Random World Generator to generate massive cave systems procedurally, includes exclusive cave prefab.  
"The Vault Pack for The Descent" Fallout Vaults under The Descent.
"Mega Pack I for The Descent" More POIs for The Descent.
"TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations"
"Sphereii One Block Crouch".  I think it accidentally fell off of the list.  
 
Updated: 
"0-SCore"
"FNS Make Quest Rewards Great Again" Thanks StallionsDen!
"Halloweeny"
"(A21 and 1.0) Black Wolf's better loot spawns"

Hotfix to include MO2 Installation.

Note: There was a problem with one of the CompoPack POIs, but it was one of my own mods causing the issue.  I fix my mod, updated it, and that fixed the compatability issue with the CP.  

1.20 17:45 EST 11JAN2025

Note 1: Moved some mods around on the list.

Status Change: Disabled "Dyable" because it's not fully functional, and causes the armor to look to glossy.
Status Change: Disabled "Trader Quest Addendum", it hasn't been updated for 1.2b27, so the special jobs it adds do not allow for normal variants to show up as job choices.   
Notes: I added notes in MO2 for every mod on the list.  If you find any mod quirks, please report them to me, and I can add them in to the next update.  

1.13: 21:00 EST 01JAN2025

Status change: I added LittleRedSonja's Christmas is Coming (Alt) back into the List as Optional.  
It was accidentally withheld from the WJ "ignore disabled" list.  

1.11: 18:55 EST 31DEC2024
Removed the FNS Loot All the Things mod, it was causing errors.  
I'll see about adding it back in at some point in the future when I have more control over the Load Order. 
That mod has always been a bit tempermental.  

1.10: 13:20 EST 31DEC2024
Fixed MO2 download issue, updated FNS POI Packs.  

1.9: 03:00 EST 31DEC2024

1.3: 20:00 EST 21DEC2024
Removed: KHV1's 12 Slot Crafting Queue because it caused an unsightly UI overlap. 
Swapped: EpicSpire's 66-Slot Backpack for CAT UI's native 91-Slot Backpack for a better overall UI cohesiveness.
