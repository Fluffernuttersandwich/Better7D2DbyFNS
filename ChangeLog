Removed: 
N/A

Added:
"7 Days To Die Gore Remover" Optional QoL mod, disabled by default.  For people who play with kids.  
"Army Biological Center" POI.  It's a great POI, but exceptionally difficult at times.  
"Random zombie idle movement speed" Optional Zombie Spawning mod.  All zombies speeds are random.  From Sloth-mode to normal to beyond Nightmare hyperspeed.  The latter can be a bit janky.

Updated: 
"EFT Extraction Pack"
"Pickup Plants Pickup Crops Gives Seeds and Living off the land bonuses too"
"DoubleBlundy's Bounty Quests V1.3 b9"
"7 Days Super Resolution(DLSS)"

Comments: 

You can call this the Perks, Sounds, and Cars update.  

1. I added a new separator in MO2 for Optional OP Perks.  Either use "Legend Perks" or "Flogi's Perk..." NOT BOTH!!!  "Natural Progression" can be used with either.

2. Added an Optional Sound Mods separator. 

3. I also added a new Cars separator.  The people asked for more cool cars, so more cars it is.  
The new Luxury cars are set to default Metallic color.  
If you don't like that color, you can manually reinstall those individual mods on your own MO2 yourself.  
Only choose one color or the mod won't work!!!

4. I added a section to the ReadMe about using Lossless Scaling to improve 7DtD performance.  
It allows me to run Ultra on this ModList with smoother graphics, and less stutters.  
It's a bit of a process to set up, but worth it if you want to get the most out of your game.  
It's very Hardware specific.  Kajdaniec and I have different profiles, I posted both.  


As always, I'd like to express my gratitude to people who comment, troubleshoot, and provide feedback.
This week's shout-outs: 
Kajdaniec for being our "unnofficial" tester!  We did a lot of LS testing this week with great results!
Cinnaspice for finding an issue with Plant Collection Challenges.  It's been reported to the Mod Author, still a WiP.  
NobodyNobody666 for the Flogi's Perk suggestion.
CarnaeAssada for helping us identify a Mod Compatibility issue with Solar Powered.  
LittleRedSonja for assisting in chasing down the Solar Powered issue.  


Removed: 

"Solar Powered"  It's redundant with Oakraven's mods, and was causing a compatibility issue with FHD.  

Added:

"Robotic Drone Headlamp Soft White" Standard Mod.  Changes Drone light mod from blue to white.

"PGz Boosted Big Cities" POI/RWG mod. Increases city sizes and allows them to spawn in all biomes.  This is redundant if you play with the CompoPack.  

"(V1) Quests Per Tier - 20" For people who want to slow down their game!
Instead of 10 quests per quest tier level, this mod makes you complete 20 quests slowing down your progression to keep the game going longer.  

"Flogi's Perk Mod" Optional OP, 
"Flogi's Perk Mod XP HUD" Optional OP, 

"Fancy Home Decor - Add-On patch" Optional Decor Add-On patch to Fancy Home Decor.  
Now the lights don't need power, and you don't need to read the Wiring 101 magazines to unlock it.  
Allows you to loot some decor blocks and resuse them from POIs.  
If you turn these mods off mid-save, it can cause errors.

"St. Mary's Hospital" Epic POI mod.  

Sound mods and Vehicles stuff, see the new separators, too many mods to list, I'm tired of typing.


Updated: 

"EFT Extraction Pack"
"ZEFT_Extraction_No_Vanilla_Guns"
"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS" tweaks to existing POIs.  
"Vault Pack for Descent"
"Danzo All Text With Shadow"
"Despawn Zombies Mod Optimize Zombie Despawning"
"...Pickup Crops"

Comments: 
Hot fix, the list was forcing users to download some mods twice, like EFT Extraction, so I figured out the problem.  
Thanks once again to Kajdaniec for noticing this issue and reporting the bug.


Removed: 
"Pick up crops" replaced with functioning version.  

Added:
"TechFreqs Pickup Plants Pickup Crops Gives Seeds and Living off the land bonuses too"

Updated: 
"RWG Mixer for Smorgasbord"

Comments: 
Updates to the ModList are usually dependant on other mods with their own dependencies getting updated.  
When the main EFT Overhaul ModPack updated last week, StallionsDen needed time to update and test the EFT Extraction Pack.
Then every day over the last week, there were like a dozen new updates of mods on the list.
Then I needed a chance to update and test Smorgasbord with all of the new updates, so that is why this update took a little longer.
I was also holding out for a new update to Izy, but that might take a bit longer...

Big thanks to Kajdaniec for creating, testing, and proving this list can work on a Dedicated Server.  
See the ReadMe on the GitHub page for reference.  

Removed: 
N/A

Added:

"Network Timeout Extension" Framework mod.  
Assists in multiplayer and Dedicated Server connection issues.  

"Galaxy Far Far Away" Optional QoL mod.  
It adds an interesting nightscape that randomly changes every night.  You can manually set one you prefer in the files.  

"(V1) Firefighter Driving Skill" Optional OP mod: 
Increases the benefit of reading The Fireman's Almanac Vol 7 : Emergency Driving.

"WMM AirDrops Spawn Zeds" Standard Mod. Spawns zombies when you go to collect the air drops.  

"WMM Loot Respawn Tweak" Standard Mod.  
Small modlet that shows what day and time a container will respawn.  
I don't think this is working with this list, still testing functionality.  

"WMM Trader Quest Map" Standard Mod. 
When you first talk to the trader about jobs, it will pop-open a map screen on the left allowing you to choose from every job available in your vicinity.
Just reengage the Trader about jobs to reopen this map screen.  Yes, I am aware of a bit of UI-screen overlap, but it works and isn't a major problem.  

"Custom FPV FOV" You can change these settings in GEARS from within the game.  

"GEARS Settings Saver" Saves GEARS settings between new worlds/games.    

"Add-on to Black Wolf's Better Loot Spawns for EFT-Extraction and Izy guns" Optional OP mod

Updated: 

"Deluxe Block POI Pack by FNS"
"RWG Mixer for Smorgasbord"
"SG Militia" POI.

Comments: 
Be mindful of the two new Environmental mods as they are Resource Intensive and could drag your performance down.  

New Separator:"Zombie Spawning Options"
After feedback from users and my own testing, I think Beefy Hordes by GR is adding in more zombies to the regular world zombies spawning.
Some players were saying it was making the game a bit too hard.  

Removed: 
"Must Load Last..." Separator.  I repurposed it, the original was unecessary, and confused users.  

Added:
"Advanced Junkyard" POI.
"SuperMax Prison" POI.
"Secret Base" POI.
"Koame's Turret Buffs": Extend turret activation range and by default you can have 3 turrets active.
"Additional Auger Blades": These tool-mods give the Auger longer/wider reach when mining to increase efficiency.
"More Armor Plates": Adds more armor-mods.
"Bump Stock": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Double Drum Magazine": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Fari's Pulse Rifle": Adds the M41A Pulse Rifle from the Aliens franchise...I'll likely add this to the Hadley's Hope POI.

"Better Biomes"
"Urban Decay"
These two are Environmental mods that add a ton of new decor to the game to make the world feel more organic.  
They're excellent, but are Resource Intensive!  
Do not use on older/weaker computers.  Even on a powerful PC, you might need to lower your settings. 

"Remove Buried Supplies Quests by GR": This mod removes T1-3 Buried Supplies Quests from possible Trader Quest selections. 
This does not remove the initial Special Quest "Introduction Buried Supplies" quest when you first meet the trader in a new game... other mods do that already.


Updated: 
"Cedar Creek" POI.
"Barricaded House" POI.  
"SG Militia" POI.
"Dwarven Citadel" POI.
"TheMeanOnes Paintings Pack x Expanded x 39 Paintings"
"CP Modded Core"
"CP Modded Traders Only"
"CBP"
"MPLogue's Prefabs"

1.35: 12:30 EST 01MAR2025

Comments: 
Added a new Separator for Quests, since they have some extra comments for how they function... mostly as Mod Compatibility warnings.  

Removed: 
"MoreQuests" When combined with various other quests mods, it could sometimes cause compatibility issues.  
Replaced with a few other mods to achieve the same effect without the issues.    

Added:
"Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable"
"Traders Have More Quests"
"Reset Trader's Quests"
"(A21 and 1.0) Black Wolf's controls improvements for helicopters and planes": 
EXPERIMENTAL: I'm not entirely sure this mod is working, could users please let me know on Discord/GitHub? 
Installing this mod was problematic, because of how the folders were subdivided. 
I think I got it to take, but I want users to confirm this installation worked for them.

Comments: 
Just some fine tuning with this update.  I am actually going to begin a playthrough on my own list, and record some videos.  

Removed: 
"TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" switched over to one by LittleRedSonja, because it can do modded workstations.  

Added:
"Grab your stuff" Pick up crates, workstations, and special modded workstations like Oakraven's stuff.
Once again, LittleRedSonja was kind enough to extend the compatibility of her mod to support our Smorgasbord.
Please Endorse her mods and let her know you appreciate her work!  

Updated:

Rebranded the ModList, it took me a little bit to figure out how to change the name, and pictures.  

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1.28: 21:25 EST 21FEB2025

Comments: 

1. Added an optional sleeping system mod: "7 Days of Insomnia". If you don't want to play with it, that's fine, again, it's optional!   

2. Shuffled some mods around on the list to better categorize them.  

3. Using "TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" mod, it doesn't currently work on the modded-oakraven workstations, only vanilla workstations.  
I might make a patch add-on for this...

4. Because we are the primary guinea pigs for the EFT Extraction Pack, if you notice a balance issue, please let me or StallionsDen know.
Example: We might pull the surgical kit in a future update... it doesn't function like it does in the EFT Overhaul, is worth too much money, and is too common to find.  

Removed: 
"More Shots" Causing an issue breaking progression for other mods.  
"Falcons Bike changes" Causing an issue breaking progression for other mods.  Sad to see this one go, but not worth the knots it tied everything up in.  
"Sleep Unitl Dawn", replaced by Insomnia.
"Jakmeister999's REASONABLE Large Stacks (V1.0)" replaced with "Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"
"REASONABLE Large Stacks for IZY AIO" replaced with "Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"

Added:
New Separator for Decor Mods.
New Separator for Insomnia Suite.
"RuntimeOCD" to help troubleshoot errors.  Please keep this one if you send me logs to troubleshoot for you!    
"7 Days of Insomnia" Sleep system.
"Dewtas Car Respawner"
"Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"
"Craftable Helmet Attribute Mods"
"DoubleBlundy's Bounty Quests" Minor mod compatibility note: This does not work with the "MoreQuests" mod.  
You cannot do these jobs until you have returned others to the traders... limited simultaneous jobs.

Updated: 
"Modded CompoPack"
"EFT Extraction Pack"
"The Descent" fixed the EFT lighting bug, and other lighting issues.
"Mega Pack I" for The Descent.  
"LittleRedSonja Ammunition Recycling".  
"OPTIONAL ADD-ON Custom Ammo Bench by LittleRedSonja"
LittleRedSonja kindly added compatibility to our EFT Extraction Pack, and Oakraven Ammo Press add-ons!  
She's wonderful!  Please thank her if you appreciate what she does for our community!

1.26, 10:15 EST 19FEB2025

Comments: 
Shucks howdy this is the biggest update I have ever done.

1. With EFT becoming massively popular, players kept asking me if it was compatible with my Mod List.  
It's not.  However, StallionsDen was working on EFT/Izy weapons compatibility.  I helped him with playtesting balance and troubleshooting some problems.
Now we have his "EFT Extraction Pack" as a mod for the list if you are a gun nut.  It's nearly 6 Gb, so don't complain about the size, it is what it is.  
EFT weapons will water down the ammo, ammo ingredient, and weapon loot tables.  That can't be helped.  
After playtesting with it for a while, I noticed ammo production will be crucial, because you will never find your flavor of ammo in large quantities.  
So I also made a patch for Oakraven's Ammo Press to support Izy and the "EFT Extraction Pack".

2. I originally held off on adding Oakraven's stuff, because I wasn't sure if it would add loot bloat, cause errors, or unnecessarily complicate the game.  
Players kept asking, and I finally decided to try using them in the list.  They intuitively work in the game, no errors, and no loot bloat.  

3. The Descent.  This is a brand new and EXPERIMENTAL mod, but from the playtesting I have done so far, it works just fine.
This Mod is Experimental!  
The Descent adds time to RWG and loading into the world.
Currently Descent has some lighting issues that will be resolved in the next update, within a week or so.  
Known issue: If you play with both the Descent and the EFT Extraction Pack, you cannot run or jump while a player light-source is on.  
I reported the bug to the author, he will patch it in a week or so.  

4. UI Options: Some players absolutely hate the CAT UI.  So, I gave them more options.  
They can now choose from four optional UI Suites: CAT UI, Steel UI, AGF HUD UI, or disable them all for the vanilla UI.

Removed: 
"Reclaim Storage Crates", replaced with a better version.

Disabled: 
"Little Buddy" currently bugged, 'worked with LRS to give the author the fix.  Keeping in the list until the author updates their mod.  

Added:
New Separator for UI Options
"Steel UI HUD" Optional UI suite.
"AGF HUD UI" Optional UI suite.
"EFT Extraction Pack" Adds the weapons, ammo, mods, injectables, first aid, and all of the ingredient components to craft them from the popular Escape from Tarkov Overhaul mod. 
"Oakraven Rock Drill" Auto-resource mining workstation.  
"Oakraven Cooking Stations" Aesthetic variant cooking workstations.
"Oakraven Cement Mixer" More efficient cement mixing.
"Oakraven Power Things" Superior late game power generation systems.  
"Oakraven Fish Farm" Adds a fish farm workstation to the game.
"Oakraven Bee Hives" Adds new workstations for honey production.
"Oakraven Balloons" Hot Air Balloons as a means of conveyance.  
"Oakraven Forges" Aesthetic variant forge workstations.
"Oakraven Walkways" Adds 'accordian' bridges
"Oakraven Self-Seed Farming" Harvestable plants in Farm Plots will self-plant instead of seed-drop.  
"Oakraven Chicken Coops" Adds a chicken coop workstation.  
"Oakraven Ammo Press" Adds an Ammo Press workstation for more efficient ammo production.  
"Ammo Press Add-On Compatibility Patch for EFT" for EFT ammo.
"Ammo Press Add-On Compatibility Patch for Izy" for Izy ammo.
"Natural Progression" Learn by doing experience system stacked on top of the learn by reading system.  
"World Ready Chime" plays a sound to let you know your game is ready to play at the spawn screen.  
"The Descent" This mod is an extension of the Random World Generator to generate massive cave systems procedurally, includes exclusive cave prefab.  
"The Vault Pack for The Descent" Fallout Vaults under The Descent.
"Mega Pack I for The Descent" More POIs for The Descent.
"TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations"
"Sphereii One Block Crouch".  I think it accidentally fell off of the list.  
 
Updated: 
"0-SCore"
"FNS Make Quest Rewards Great Again" Thanks StallionsDen!
"Halloweeny"
"(A21 and 1.0) Black Wolf's better loot spawns"

Added POI mods: Baron Wildpig's Castle (with zombies), Ultra Scans Clinic.  
Note 1: Moved some mods around on the list.  
Note 2: If you have a higher-end machine, with a GPU that supports RTX, I recommend fiddling with Torch and Super Resolution (DLSS) settings.  My game is looking gorgeous with these!

Added, QoL Optional: "LittleRedSonja_T2IT3_ADD-ON_POSTERS" decor mod.
Updated: "LittleRedSonja T2 into T3 grade weapons"
Status Change: Disabled "Dyable" because it's not fully functional, and causes the armor to look to glossy.
Status Change: Disabled "Trader Quest Addendum", it hasn't been updated for 1.2b27, so the special jobs it adds do not allow for normal variants to show up as job choices.   
Notes: I added notes in MO2 for every mod on the list.  If you find any mod quirks, please report them to me, and I can add them in to the next update.  

1.13: 21:00 EST 01JAN2025

1.12: 07:30 EST 01JAN2025
Status change: I added LittleRedSonja's Christmas is Coming (Alt) back into the List as Optional.  
It was accidentally withheld from the WJ "ignore disabled" list.  

1.11: 18:55 EST 31DEC2024
Removed the FNS Loot All the Things mod, it was causing errors.  
I'll see about adding it back in at some point in the future when I have more control over the Load Order. 
That mod has always been a bit tempermental.  

1.10: 13:20 EST 31DEC2024
Fixed MO2 download issue, updated FNS POI Packs.  

1.9: 03:00 EST 31DEC2024
I had a mistake in compiling this small update in MO2.  
I accidentally left the MO2 installation off of the download requirement.  
My apologies to anyone this inconvenienced.
