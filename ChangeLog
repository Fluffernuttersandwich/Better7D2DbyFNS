Added: "Legend Perks Compatibility Patch".  This tweaks the "Legend Perks" mod so you only gain 1 Perk Point per level (and not 2).  
Added: "7DtD MO2 PLugin". I had to repackage the MO2 plugin as my own since the other one had the wrong folder structure.  
Updated: "Sensible Lootz"
Updated: "7 Days Super Resolution(DLSS)"
Updated: "Better 7D2D ModList POI Pack"
Updated: "Mod Organizer 2 Plugin"
Updated: "Clopex Estate"
Removed: "No Nerd Pole", it was deleted from Nexus Mods.  
Removed: "OG Trader Joel Voice Lines".  Error.
Removed: "PGz All Map Size generator v1". Redundant with the Modded CompoPack.
Removed: "World Gen Tweaker". Redundant with the Modded CompoPack.
Removed: "Unlocked Traders". Redundant with the Modded CompoPack.
Removed: "UltraScans..." POI. It was made without a ModInfo.xml file causing an installation problem.  
Note: There was a problem with one of the CompoPack POIs, but it was one of my own mods causing the issue.  I fix my mod, updated it, and that fixed the compatability issue with the CP.  

1.20 17:45 EST 11JAN2025

1.17 14:45 EST 05JAN2025
Added a new Separator in MO2: "Optional Performance and Graphics Tweaks (These mods may be hardware specific and might require additional knowledge to use correctly)"
Added Framework Mod: "Gears", adds a UI to the in-game Menu Screen, needed for "Torch".
Added Gfx/Perf Optional Mod: "Torch" to allow you to configure Lighting from the Gears menu. Will not work on potato hardware.  For Advanced Users!  Please read that mods page for more info. 
Added Gfx/Perf Optional Mod: "7 Days Super Resolution", provides DLSS options for users with a GPU that supports RTX.  For Advanced Users!  Please read that mods page for more info. 
Added Standard Mod: "Crafting Dew Collector Mods".  I thought we already had this one, but must have forgot to include it.  I only discovered it was missing when I went to go try and make a filter.   
Added POI mods: Baron Wildpig's Castle (with zombies), Ultra Scans Clinic.  
Note 1: Moved some mods around on the list.  
Note 2: If you have a higher-end machine, with a GPU that supports RTX, I recommend fiddling with Torch and Super Resolution (DLSS) settings.  My game is looking gorgeous with these!

1.16 19:00 EST 03JAN2025
Update: "Sensible Lootz".

Added, OP Optional: "Sensible Lootz", find weapons in weapon bags.
Added, OP Optional: "Black Wolf's Better Loot Spawns", improves loot spawns, and variety.
Update: "Make Quest Rewards Great Again", had a bug that caused CTD, and/or not being able to collect rewards from a trader... typo on my part, sorry about that.  

1.14 23:30 EST 02JAN2025
Added, OP Optional: "FNS Make Quest Rewards Great Again", this mod returns the Quest Reward system back to how it was in A21, meaning you can get guns, like Izy's Guns as Quest Rewards.  
Added, OP Optional: "Reduce Demolisher Damage".
Added, OP Optional: "FPS No Demolishers".
Added, OP Optional: "Start with 10 Forge Aheads by GR".
Added, QoL Optional: "LittleRedSonja_T2IT3_ADD-ON_POSTERS" decor mod.
Updated: "LittleRedSonja T2 into T3 grade weapons"
Status Change: Disabled "Dyable" because it's not fully functional, and causes the armor to look to glossy.
Status Change: Disabled "Trader Quest Addendum", it hasn't been updated for 1.2b27, so the special jobs it adds do not allow for normal variants to show up as job choices.   
Notes: I added notes in MO2 for every mod on the list.  If you find any mod quirks, please report them to me, and I can add them in to the next update.  

1.13: 21:00 EST 01JAN2025
Removed: All three OSD mods because they were causing an FPS crater in some of the CompoPack POIs.  
Removed: Both WookieNookie Named Zombies and Named Animal mods.  They had a minor conflict of not naming new mob types.  
Status Change: Disabled Trader Quest Addendum, awaiting update... if used now, you won't get the option of vanilla quest types.  

1.12: 07:30 EST 01JAN2025
Status change: I added LittleRedSonja's Christmas is Coming (Alt) back into the List as Optional.  
It was accidentally withheld from the WJ "ignore disabled" list.  

1.11: 18:55 EST 31DEC2024
Removed the FNS Loot All the Things mod, it was causing errors.  
I'll see about adding it back in at some point in the future when I have more control over the Load Order. 
That mod has always been a bit tempermental.  

1.10: 13:20 EST 31DEC2024
Fixed MO2 download issue, updated FNS POI Packs.  

1.9: 03:00 EST 31DEC2024
I had a mistake in compiling this small update in MO2.

Added: Guppy's Fire Mod to the Optional QoL section, but with the caveat that once you enable, don't disable in the same save world.  

1.3: 20:00 EST 21DEC2024
Removed: KHV1's 12 Slot Crafting Queue because it caused an unsightly UI overlap. 
Swapped: EpicSpire's 66-Slot Backpack for CAT UI's native 91-Slot Backpack for a better overall UI cohesiveness.  
Added: Immersive Crosshair, and Dot Crosshair as Optional QoL mods
Fixed: Issue where not all of the POI mods were loading due to double-nested mod folders

1.2: 16:35 EST, 20DEC2024
