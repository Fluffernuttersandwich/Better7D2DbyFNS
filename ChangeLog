Comments: 
Be mindful of the two new Environmental mods as they are Resource Intensive and could drag your performance down.  

New Separator:"Zombie Spawning Options"
After feedback from users and my own testing, I think Beefy Hordes by GR is adding in more zombies to the regular world zombies spawning.
Some players were saying it was making the game a bit too hard.  

Removed: 
"Must Load Last..." Separator.  I repurposed it, the original was unecessary, and confused users.  

Added:
"Advanced Junkyard" POI.
"SuperMax Prison" POI.
"Secret Base" POI.
"Koame's Turret Buffs": Extend turret activation range and by default you can have 3 turrets active.
"Additional Auger Blades": These tool-mods give the Auger longer/wider reach when mining to increase efficiency.
"More Armor Plates": Adds more armor-mods.
"Bump Stock": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Double Drum Magazine": Weapon-mod For some vanilla guns.  
"Fari's Pulse Rifle": Adds the M41A Pulse Rifle from the Aliens franchise...I'll likely add this to the Hadley's Hope POI.

"Better Biomes"
"Urban Decay"
These two are Environmental mods that add a ton of new decor to the game to make the world feel more organic.  
They're excellent, but are Resource Intensive!  
Do not use on older/weaker computers.  Even on a powerful PC, you might need to lower your settings. 

"Remove Buried Supplies Quests by GR": This mod removes T1-3 Buried Supplies Quests from possible Trader Quest selections. 
This does not remove the initial Special Quest "Introduction Buried Supplies" quest when you first meet the trader in a new game... other mods do that already.


Updated: 
"Cedar Creek" POI.
"Barricaded House" POI.  
"SG Militia" POI.
"Dwarven Citadel" POI.
"TheMeanOnes Paintings Pack x Expanded x 39 Paintings"
"CP Modded Core"
"CP Modded Traders Only"
"CBP"
"MPLogue's Prefabs"

Comments: 
Added a new Separator for Quests, since they have some extra comments for how they function... mostly as Mod Compatibility warnings.  

Removed: 
"MoreQuests" When combined with various other quests mods, it could sometimes cause compatibility issues.  
Replaced with a few other mods to achieve the same effect without the issues.    

Added:
"Dewtas Hold Multiple Quests -- 1.0 Stable"
"Traders Have More Quests"
"Reset Trader's Quests"
"(A21 and 1.0) Black Wolf's controls improvements for helicopters and planes": 
EXPERIMENTAL: I'm not entirely sure this mod is working, could users please let me know on Discord/GitHub? 
Installing this mod was problematic, because of how the folders were subdivided. 
I think I got it to take, but I want users to confirm this installation worked for them.

Updated:

Just some fine tuning with this update.  I am actually going to begin a playthrough on my own list, and record some videos.  

Removed: 
"TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" switched over to one by LittleRedSonja, because it can do modded workstations.  

Added:
"Grab your stuff" Pick up crates, workstations, and special modded workstations like Oakraven's stuff.

Please Endorse her mods and let her know you appreciate her work!

Rebranded the ModList, it took me a little bit to figure out how to change the name, and pictures.  

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1.28: 21:25 EST 21FEB2025

Comments: 

1. Added an optional sleeping system mod: "7 Days of Insomnia". If you don't want to play with it, that's fine, again, it's optional!   

2. Shuffled some mods around on the list to better categorize them.  

3. Using "TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations" mod, it doesn't currently work on the modded-oakraven workstations, only vanilla workstations.  
I might make a patch add-on for this...

4. Because we are the primary guinea pigs for the EFT Extraction Pack, if you notice a balance issue, please let me or StallionsDen know.
Example: We might pull the surgical kit in a future update... it doesn't function like it does in the EFT Overhaul, is worth too much money, and is too common to find.  

Removed: 
"More Shots" Causing an issue breaking progression for other mods.  
"Falcons Bike changes" Causing an issue breaking progression for other mods.  Sad to see this one go, but not worth the knots it tied everything up in.  
"Sleep Unitl Dawn", replaced by Insomnia.
"Jakmeister999's REASONABLE Large Stacks (V1.0)" replaced with "Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"
"REASONABLE Large Stacks for IZY AIO" replaced with "Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"

Added:
New Separator for Decor Mods.
New Separator for Insomnia Suite.
"RuntimeOCD" to help troubleshoot errors.  Please keep this one if you send me logs to troubleshoot for you!    
"7 Days of Insomnia" Sleep system.
"Dewtas Car Respawner"
"Stallionsdens Stack Size Increaser V1.0"
"Craftable Helmet Attribute Mods"
"DoubleBlundy's Bounty Quests" Minor mod compatibility note: This does not work with the "MoreQuests" mod.  
You cannot do these jobs until you have returned others to the traders... limited simultaneous jobs.

Updated: 
"Modded CompoPack"
"EFT Extraction Pack"
"The Descent" fixed the EFT lighting bug, and other lighting issues.
"Mega Pack I" for The Descent.  
"LittleRedSonja Ammunition Recycling".  
"OPTIONAL ADD-ON Custom Ammo Bench by LittleRedSonja"
LittleRedSonja kindly added compatibility to our EFT Extraction Pack, and Oakraven Ammo Press add-ons!  
She's wonderful!  Please thank her if you appreciate what she does for our community!

Hot Fix: Reuploaded a newer version of "FNS Less Screamers Please" due to a hashing issue stalling the download process for some users.

Comments: 
Shucks howdy this is the biggest update I have ever done.

1. With EFT becoming massively popular, players kept asking me if it was compatible with my Mod List.  
It's not.  However, StallionsDen was working on EFT/Izy weapons compatibility.  I helped him with playtesting balance and troubleshooting some problems.
Now we have his "EFT Extraction Pack" as a mod for the list if you are a gun nut.  It's nearly 6 Gb, so don't complain about the size, it is what it is.  
EFT weapons will water down the ammo, ammo ingredient, and weapon loot tables.  That can't be helped.  
After playtesting with it for a while, I noticed ammo production will be crucial, because you will never find your flavor of ammo in large quantities.  
So I also made a patch for Oakraven's Ammo Press to support Izy and the "EFT Extraction Pack".

2. I originally held off on adding Oakraven's stuff, because I wasn't sure if it would add loot bloat, cause errors, or unnecessarily complicate the game.  
Players kept asking, and I finally decided to try using them in the list.  They intuitively work in the game, no errors, and no loot bloat.  

3. The Descent.  This is a brand new and EXPERIMENTAL mod, but from the playtesting I have done so far, it works just fine.
This Mod is Experimental!  
The Descent adds time to RWG and loading into the world.
Currently Descent has some lighting issues that will be resolved in the next update, within a week or so.  
Known issue: If you play with both the Descent and the EFT Extraction Pack, you cannot run or jump while a player light-source is on.  
I reported the bug to the author, he will patch it in a week or so.  

4. UI Options: Some players absolutely hate the CAT UI.  So, I gave them more options.  
They can now choose from four optional UI Suites: CAT UI, Steel UI, AGF HUD UI, or disable them all for the vanilla UI.

Removed: 
"Reclaim Storage Crates", replaced with a better version.

Disabled: 
"Little Buddy" currently bugged, 'worked with LRS to give the author the fix.  Keeping in the list until the author updates their mod.  

Added:
New Separator for UI Options
"Steel UI HUD" Optional UI suite.
"AGF HUD UI" Optional UI suite.
"EFT Extraction Pack" Adds the weapons, ammo, mods, injectables, first aid, and all of the ingredient components to craft them from the popular Escape from Tarkov Overhaul mod. 
"Oakraven Rock Drill" Auto-resource mining workstation.  
"Oakraven Cooking Stations" Aesthetic variant cooking workstations.
"Oakraven Cement Mixer" More efficient cement mixing.
"Oakraven Power Things" Superior late game power generation systems.  
"Oakraven Fish Farm" Adds a fish farm workstation to the game.
"Oakraven Bee Hives" Adds new workstations for honey production.
"Oakraven Balloons" Hot Air Balloons as a means of conveyance.  
"Oakraven Forges" Aesthetic variant forge workstations.
"Oakraven Walkways" Adds 'accordian' bridges
"Oakraven Self-Seed Farming" Harvestable plants in Farm Plots will self-plant instead of seed-drop.  
"Oakraven Chicken Coops" Adds a chicken coop workstation.  
"Oakraven Ammo Press" Adds an Ammo Press workstation for more efficient ammo production.  
"Ammo Press Add-On Compatibility Patch for EFT" for EFT ammo.
"Ammo Press Add-On Compatibility Patch for Izy" for Izy ammo.
"Natural Progression" Learn by doing experience system stacked on top of the learn by reading system.  
"World Ready Chime" plays a sound to let you know your game is ready to play at the spawn screen.  
"The Descent" This mod is an extension of the Random World Generator to generate massive cave systems procedurally, includes exclusive cave prefab.  
"The Vault Pack for The Descent" Fallout Vaults under The Descent.
"Mega Pack I for The Descent" More POIs for The Descent.
"TheMeanOnes Pickup Crates N Workstations"
"Sphereii One Block Crouch".  I think it accidentally fell off of the list.  
 
Updated: 
"0-SCore"
"FNS Make Quest Rewards Great Again" Thanks StallionsDen!
"Halloweeny"
"(A21 and 1.0) Black Wolf's better loot spawns"

Note 1: Moved some mods around on the list.

Status Change: Disabled "Dyable" because it's not fully functional, and causes the armor to look to glossy.
Status Change: Disabled "Trader Quest Addendum", it hasn't been updated for 1.2b27, so the special jobs it adds do not allow for normal variants to show up as job choices.   
Notes: I added notes in MO2 for every mod on the list.  If you find any mod quirks, please report them to me, and I can add them in to the next update.  

1.13: 21:00 EST 01JAN2025

Status change: I added LittleRedSonja's Christmas is Coming (Alt) back into the List as Optional.  
It was accidentally withheld from the WJ "ignore disabled" list.  

1.11: 18:55 EST 31DEC2024
Removed the FNS Loot All the Things mod, it was causing errors.  
I'll see about adding it back in at some point in the future when I have more control over the Load Order. 
That mod has always been a bit tempermental.

Fixed MO2 download issue, updated FNS POI Packs.  

1.9: 03:00 EST 31DEC2024

1.3: 20:00 EST 21DEC2024
Removed: KHV1's 12 Slot Crafting Queue because it caused an unsightly UI overlap. 
Swapped: EpicSpire's 66-Slot Backpack for CAT UI's native 91-Slot Backpack for a better overall UI cohesiveness.
