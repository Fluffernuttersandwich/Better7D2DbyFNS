Added, OP Optional: "FNS Make Quest Rewards Great Again", this mod returns the Quest Reward system back to how it was in A21, meaning you can get guns, like Izy's Guns as Quest Rewards.  
Added, OP Optional: "Reduce Demolisher Damage".
Added, OP Optional: "FPS No Demolishers".
Added, OP Optional: "Start with 10 Forge Aheads by GR".
Added, QoL Optional: "LittleRedSonja_T2IT3_ADD-ON_POSTERS" decor mod.
Updated: "LittleRedSonja T2 into T3 grade weapons"
Status Change: Disabled "Dyable" because it's not fully functional, and causes the armor to look to glossy.
Status Change: Disabled "Trader Quest Addendum", it hasn't been updated for 1.2b27, so the special jobs it adds do not allow for normal variants to show up as job choices.   
Notes: I added notes in MO2 for every mod on the list.  If you find any mod quirks, please report them to me, and I can add them in to the next update.

Removed: All three OSD mods because they were causing an FPS crater in some of the CompoPack POIs.  
Removed: Both WookieNookie Named Zombies and Named Animal mods.  They had a minor conflict of not naming new mob types.

Removed the FNS Loot All the Things mod, it was causing errors.  
I'll see about adding it back in at some point in the future when I have more control over the Load Order. 
That mod has always been a bit tempermental.
