# Better7D2DbyFNS
This is a Overhaul Modlist for the game 7 Days to Die for the ModLauncher (ML) Mod Manager.
This Overhaul ModPack is to the premier Quality of Life (QoL) Vanilla+ experience for 7D2D.
It provides a stable and enhanced playthrough for those who like the base game, but wish there was more to it.

## Vision for this Collection

### It's 7 Days to Die, *only better.*

When people think of a stable Vanilla+ mod pack that enhances the original game, I want them to think of this ModList.  
This list is friendly to a more casual play style for people who want a relaxed game experience.  If you are a hardcore gamer, this pack is not for you.

## Description
Most of the mods in this collection are Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to give the players a nice Vanilla+ experience without any game breaking balance issues you see in some other mod lists.  
This Collection is not about overhauling anything, nor adding too many new features.  
This list is all about improving dozens of small details that as a whole make for a better overall experience of the original game.  
Unlike other overhaul mod packs, you are not learning a new game. 
Balance is subjective.  Some people think this Collection makes the game too easy.  If you feel that way, disable the mods you don't like, and/or play with harder difficulty settings.

# Installation Directions

Thou shalt read the directions and troubleshooting sections prior to asking for technical assistance.  

## Assumptions 

A. You have already installed 7D2D, using the latest *stable* version.  Currently, this is: v1.1b14

B. EAC has been disabled from the Game Launcher.

C. You did *not* delete the "0_TFP_Harmony" folder!

D. You ran the vanilla game to the main start-up menu once.  *This is so it can build out folder directories.*  

E. You are not running Mods out of any other folder that could cause a potential Mod Conflict.

F. You are literate, and have basic computer literacy to figure simple things out for yourself.

### Step 1:

Download ModOrganizer2 (MO2)
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files

Install it.

### Step 2. 

Download the 7D2D MO2 Plugin v2
https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5624?tab=files
Unzip this in the folder where you installed MO2.  
If Windows prompts you to overwrite the existing files in the MO2 folder, the answer is yes.

Load MO2 once, then exit MO2.  

### Step 3. 

Install Wabbajack.  
If you already have Wabbajack installed, you must update it to the most current version.  
Older versions of Wabbajack do not support 7D2D.  7D2D only recently received Wabbajack support.  

### Step 4. 

Search for the 7 Days to Die game in Wabbajack. 
Download the "Better7D2DbyFNS" Overhaul ModPack.

### Step 5. 

When Wabbajack has finished the download, unzipping, and installation, run the MO2 file for "Better7D2DbyFNS".

### Step 6.

Customize the ModList in MO2 to suit your personal preferences.  

### Step 7.  Play the game.

Create a new world with advanced generation.  I recommend 8-10k sized maps to see all of the Community made POIs.  
Random World Generation (RWG) will take much longer than vanilla.  10-40 minutes depending on hardware.
Do not make maps larger than 10k if you are using potato grade hardware.  It could crash in RWG, or mid-game.
