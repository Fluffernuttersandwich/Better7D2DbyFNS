______________________________________________________________________________________________________


**Smörgåsbord**

/ ˈsmɔr gəsˌbɔrd, -ˌboʊrdor, often, ˈʃmɔr- /

_noun_

an extensive array or variety:

That list is a _smorgasbord_ of mods.


______________________________________________________________________________________________________


## Distinctive features about this Mod List:

- This is the most modular approach to modding you will see for a 7DtD ModPack.
Unlike other Overhaul Lists that add things not all players like, you have complete control over what mods to enable/disable in your game to suit your own play style by using ModOrganizer2 (MO2). 

- You are not learning a new game.  Yet, it still feels like a fresh experience.
I try to add mods that are intuitive.
I dislike systems that require you to go read third party documentation just to play a game. 

- This Mod List is not about overhauling major systems, nor adding too many new features.
This list is all about improving dozens of small details that as a whole make for a better overall experience of the original game.

- Most of the mods in this collection are Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to give the players a nice Vanilla+ experience without any game breaking balance issues you see in some other mod lists.

- **Balance is subjective.**
Some people think this Collection makes the game too easy.
If you feel that way, disable the mods you don't like, and/or play with harder difficulty settings.


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


## Vision for this ModList (aka Overhaul ModPack)

### It's <ins>**7 Days to Die**</ins>, *only better.*

When people think of a stable Vanilla+ mod pack that enhances the original game, I want them to think of this ModList.

I have tried to make this Mod List flexible enough to appeal to anyone depending on how you customize the mods.

For Casual Gamers, you can disable some of the challenging mods.

For Hardcore gamers, disable the OP mods, and enable the challenging mods.

For Power Gaming Munchkins, you can turn on every OP mod.

- If you are brand new to Modding, and Wabbajack/MO2 in particular, start here for an overview: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9jDnjSRqOE

The YouTube Content Creator **DroppedIceCream** does a lot of reviews of ModLists for games like Skyrim and Fallout.  

So check out his reviews if you are interested in learning about some of the best mods for those games.    


--- 

### Why you should consider using this Wabbajack-MO2 ModList

- For users with a Premium NexusMods account, it is damn-near a "one-touch" modding solution to give you the best mods available for 7DtD.

- Even if you only have a Free NexusMods account, I've done all the work of collecting these mods and testing their Load Order for you.  
So, even though you need to click through to download each mod, one-at-a-time, it's still faster than you doing it yourself, and with no wasted time spent troubleshooting the Load Order to sort out mod conflicts.

- This ModList is self-contained, meaning you can have concurrent games of **Darkness Falls**, **Rebirth**, Vanilla, and my **Smörgåsbord** ModPack all without issue, so long as you don't add mods in these locations, you are good to go!

[Requirements and Recommended Hardware Specs](##Requirements-and-Recommended-Hardware-Specs).



## Requirements and Recommended Hardware Specs


1. Hardware capable of running the base game of 7DtD.

If you can run the base game, you can run _most_ of the mods on this ModList without any issues.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15da16e1-14f4-4461-a89a-2618035a5363)

Some of the mods will lower FPS (15-30) somewhat, if you are experiencing issues, you could lower your Graphic Settings from Ultra to High or lower as needed depending on your hardware constraints.  

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not make maps larger than 10k if you are running on potato-grade hardware!
> Even if you are able to generate the map, the game could become corrupted after several hours into a playthrough.  


> [!WARNING]
> The Descent mod(s) require more Memory than the vanilla game.
>
> Do not generate a Descent map above 10k unless you are running rich-boi NASA systems.  
>
> When you are RWG-ing a new world, or loading into a new world, disable all other programs if you are on older hardware.
>
> I have seen some user reports saying 16Gb of RAM is/isn't enough for the Descent.  Your Mileage May Vary(YMMV).  
> 
> I was able to create and play on a 6k Descent RWG-ed map using a 10 year old gaming laptop with 32 Gb of RAM.  
>  
> If you are getting unexplainable Crash-to-Desktop (CTD), and Crash-Report logs saying:
> 
> 'Could not allocate memory: System out of memory!' while Descent is running in the Console,
> 
> your hardware is likey not able to support The Descent suite of mods.

> [!WARNING]
> MPLogue's "Better Biomes" and will hit your performance 15-30 FPS.
> 
> A. Optimize your PC for performance.
> 
> B. Lower your Graphics settings.
> 
> C. See the write-up further below on if you should consider using the Lossless Scaling Application.  
>
> D. Play without these mods.


> [!TIP]
> A. Follow most (but not all) of the PC-Gaming Optimization steps in this video.
> It's Primarily for CounterStrike2, but ignore the CS2 sections, and skip the "Advanced" Section entirely.
> I squeezed an additional 20 FPS from using most of those steps.
> https://youtu.be/p-gXanyB69o?si=tzUZlr5gkYLEFGMj
>
> B. If you are on older/weaker hardware having trouble loading a game, try disabling some more mods in MO2.
> Start by disabling the decor mods under the Decor Separator in MO2.



2. The latest version of Wabbajack.
Wabbajack only recently added 7DtD compatability, so you must use the latest version or the game will not be available.

https://www.wabbajack.org/ 

3. Storage consideration: currently the collection is about 40GB.
"What?! but 7D2D mods are small?!"
Yes, generally, but mods like: the CompoPack, EFT Extraction Pack, Izy's AIO Gun Pack, Bdub's vehicles, and all the Decor mods add up.
Do you want to play a nice list or not?


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


# **Commandment Zero: Thou shalt read the Assumptions, Installation Directions, and Troubleshooting sections prior to asking for technical assistance.  There's a 99% chance your issue is covered there.**  

## Assumptions 


A. You have already installed 7D2D, using the latest *stable* version of the game.  Currently, this is: **2.2**

_This list is exclusively compatible with this version!_

---

B. EAC has been disabled from the Game Launcher.  Not just temporarily muted for a session, but actually disabled so it will not attempt to launch!

---

C. You did *not* delete the "0_TFP_Harmony" folder in the base game's Mods folder!  
>  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods

<img width="726" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdf7e4ab-e98b-44cc-9fe3-f00788e4e0d0" />


---

D. You ran the vanilla game to the main start-up menu once.  *This is so it can build out folder directories.*
_This is considered best practice/mandatory for modding most games._

---

E. You are not running Mods out of any other folder that could cause a potential Mod Conflict.
If you have Mods running out of the base game Mods folder, or Vortex Mods folder, remove/disable them!
If you have Mods in a self-contained system like ModLauncher, that's fine, it won't interact.

> [!WARNING]
> Please save yourself hours of aggravation and double-check that you have **Removed all mods from the Mods folders:**
> 
> C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods
> 
> Do *not* delete the "0_TFP_Harmony" folder!!!
> 
> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods
> 
> With the exception of the "0_TFP_Harmony" folder, both of those folders should be empty!  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dc12ac2-57aa-4e6a-8ce7-efc9cbaf5d85)

---

_Assumptions continued..._

F. You are literate, and have basic computer literacy to figure simple things out for yourself.

---

G. If you edited or added _ANYTHING_ to the main game folder directory, you will _probably_ need to perform a full uninstall and reinstall of the base game.  

"But why?!" you ask?  
Because Wabbajack will compare the hash files of your base game files to it's vanilla base game hash values, and if they are off, it _might_ cause errors in installing your ModList.

> [!TIP]
> **It's always considered best practice to use a fresh clean vanilla install for _any_ Overhaul ModPack**

... examples of you molesting base game files include: adding a ReShade, injecting the SkipNews Mod into base files, same for the Skip TFP Loading Screen Mod, adding additional folders, in-file gfx tweaks, making changes to vanilla folders/files, etc.  

**If you feel like getting this installation right the first time, perform a full uninstall/reinstall.**

---

H. Best Practice for all PC Gaming, and especially Modding: **Store Mods and Mod Applications in the correct locations!**

> [!WARNING]
> Never name your download/installation folder/sub-folder directory "downloads"!
> It will confuse the download process because MO2 creates its own "downloads" folder.
> If you did this, you messed up.  You _might_ be able to rename your folder/manually move files, but chances are, you need to start again.  

**In Windows, you should avoid storing mods on your system drive (usually labeled as "C:"), _if possible_**

particularly in locations like the "Program Files" folder, 
as this can cause potential issues with game updates, compatibility problems, 
and might even lead to your mods being accidentally deleted during system maintenance or updates. 

Here are a few specific places to _avoid_ storing mods on Windows:

Program Files folder: This directory is designed for system files and applications, not user-generated content like mods.

Windows directory: Similarly, the core Windows directory should not be used for storing mods.

Temporary folders: Avoid storing mods in temporary folders as they may be deleted automatically by the system.

**Where _to_ store Mods, Modding Applications, folder paths, and folders instead:**

**Dedicated drive:**
Ideally, you have a separate hard drive for Modding.  
If so, consider storing your mods on that drive to maximize space and avoid potential conflicts with your system files.
If you have a spare drive (like a D Drive), store Mod Applications, file paths, and folders there!!!  This is best practice for modding any game!  

Example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87030c6e-60de-4921-9cd0-5cca3f885389)

If you only have one drive, like C:, and the OS is on it, then create your own Modding folder on the OS Drive like this example:
_This is the second best option if you don't have a spare drive._

### C:\Modding

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93b78bfe-12f6-4a76-aa55-423fc7ac73ea)

I. **Do not install/use your own MO2!**

> [!WARNING]
> This ModList uses it's own modified instance of MO2, and it is part of the download of this Wabbajack list.  
> Do not use a standard MO2 install downloaded from other locations, it will (probably) not work!
> Again, this Wabbajack list download process will include it's own modified instance for MO2.  Use this one!

J. **Create Antivirus Exceptions for the MO2 and 7D2D Executables**

You might need to create Antivirus Exceptions for MO2 and 7DtD executables. 

There are other programs that might be preventing you from launching 7DtD from MO2.  

These might include: Antivirus, Firewalls, steelseries, light-controlling apps, performance monitoring software, etc.  

Sometimes you need to restart Steam, or your PC as well. 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Installation Directions

---
Here is a generic write-up from Wabbajack: https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Installing%20a%20Modlist.html
---

## Step 0: You must have a Nexus Mods account.

Either Free or Premium will work.  

If you have a Free account, prepare to do _a lot_ of clicking.  
For Free accounts, Wabbajack will open one-browser-tab-at-a-time, for you to manually download each mod.  
500+ mods = 500+ tabs to open and click through one-at-a-time. 

Premium accounts will click once to download all of the Nexus mods, and download them at a higher speed.  

If you don't already have an account, you can register here:
https://users.nexusmods.com/register

Remember these login credentials, as you will need to use them to connect the Wabbajack application to the NexusMods page later.

---

## Step 1: 

To get ModOrganizer2 (MO2) to work, you will need:
Windows 10 1809+ or Windows 11 are now required due to the upgrade to Qt 6 and Python 3.11.
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 14.40.33810.0 is required, install from https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe if needed.

If you are not sure you have it, download and install it now.

---

## Step 2.  Download/update to the latest version of Wabbajack: https://www.wabbajack.org/

If you already have Wabbajack installed, you _must_ update it to the most current version.

Older versions of Wabbajack do not support 7D2D!  

7D2D only recently received Wabbajack support! 

Chances are, you are running an older version.  

It won't prompt you to update from within the application, so go download the new version.

https://www.wabbajack.org/ 

Wabbajack will store multiple versions of itself on your system if you don't do housekeeping, so make sure you are launching the _newest_ version. 

_*cough *cough, update the shortcut/pin on your taskbar._

_If you are new to modding, please see the "Assumptions" section of this write up above, bullet point "H" for where/where-not-to store things when modding._


Before going any further, connect your Login from Nexus Mods to Wabbajack in the Wabbajack application.
From the Wabbajack application main screen, press the settings "gearwheel" icon on the top right.
Login to your Nexus Mods account from inside of the Wabbajack application, and enter your credentials.

**If you successfully entered your login username, password, captcha, and (optional) MFA token; it will look like this screenshot.**

<img width="1425" height="678" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb20c87-4d54-48a5-8601-cb4f984f3076" />


---

### Step 3. Find the "Smörgåsbord" by FNS Overhaul ModPack in the Wabbajack Gallery of ModLists.  

From the Wabbajack Appliction, press the "Browse lists" button:

You can press the "All games" dropdown arrow and select 7 Days to Die.  Make sure - Include "Non-featured" - is also checked.  

Sometimes the Wabbajack App gets stuck, and will only display 50+ ModLists instead of 120+... if this happens: 

Reset Filters, then try again to select Non-Featured ModLists, and the dropdown should be back to 120+ ModLists.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c820a0a-ff11-4fe8-b518-2e2b3f58c0dd)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba042aa5-065b-40c4-9ee6-5fe751f203a3)



At the time of this writting, my ModPack is the first and only Wabbajack list for the 7DtD game.

Click the "Smörgåsbord" Overhaul ModPack.

Now press the "Download & Install" button.


<img width="1414" height="681" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7201ff30-09cb-479e-a239-4f51d9b06d20" />



The Wabbajack Application will prompt you to input an Installation Location folder:

As an example, I made a New Folder, in my Modding Folder, called: "WJ_MO2_7D2D_Installation"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9681a93c-77d5-4f39-8ae5-cc6c7a23ea5d)

_If you are new to modding, please see the "Assumptions" section of this write up above, bullet point "H" for where/where-not-to store things when modding._   

Here's what it looks like as Wabbajack is downloading and installing the ModList:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99c3626c-8735-4bdc-acd2-b16e11419ee3)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e459127-0ce9-41d2-b89c-185cc861b846)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c395d4b-7890-45d2-9828-f18119963a39)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6797a7ba-23b9-44ed-a8b9-d9eea8d68214)


---

## Step 4. Open MO2 launcher for "Smörgåsbord".

When Wabbajack has finished the download, unzipping, and installation of the ModList, Launch the MO2 application ModList for "Smörgåsbord".  

Launch this MO2 instance from where you installed the Wabbajack files for this ModList.

> [!TIP]
> It would be prudent of you to make a shortcut, or pin to taskbar of this "Smörgåsbord" MO2 instance.

_What do I press when MO2 says: "Mod Organizer is not set up to handle nxm links.  Associate it with nxm links?"_

Press the `Yes` button.  

This will tell the NexusMods website to associate this instance of MO2 as your ModManager of choice to download mods. 

It's temporary, you can associate another mO2 instance, or Vortex next time you go to open those.  

Be careful if you switch to/have MO2 and Vortex open at the same time downloading mods... you'll accidentally start downloading 7dtd mods to Skyrim.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65cfab71-5be8-4598-b668-f0da4eb48fb4)

---

## Step 5. Customize the ModList in MO2 to suit your personal preferences.  

> [!CAUTION]
> Do _not_ rearrange the Priority (Load Order) unless you know what you are doing!  
> I hand-tailored the priority (Load Order) to avoid mod conflicts.  
> If you mess that up, I cannot/will-not fix it for you, and you will need to uninstall/reinstall the ModList.  

_The following screenshots in this section were uploaded from Revision version 1.0 of this Overhaul ModPack._  

## Do not disable **Framework/Requirement Mods** (unless you are an advanced modder and you know what you are doing).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07fed2a2-1379-4cc7-8c13-f06d4c307889)

### **UI Suite Option**  

![UI_Options](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea44bbca-91af-4c17-8c71-a1a0ef31e76d)

> [!CAUTION]
> Choose only one UI Provider or disable them all!  Do not mix and match from multiple Providers.

**Pick _one_ UI Suite from the following three options:**

A. CAT UI

B. Steel UI

C. Disable all the UI mods, and play with the vanilla UI.


You can play with the minimap settings under the GEARS "Mods" section in the Game's Menu Options.

**GEARS Mods > Quartz > Minimap tab.**

The minimap has an overlap with the Steel-UI 15-slot toolbelt.  

You can live with it, use a different UI, disable the 15-Slot toolbelt, or use the Immersive Toolbelt mod so it's less of an issue. 


### **Prefabs, POIs, and RWG tweaks.**  
If you want to add _and_ enable, or disable any prefab/POIs, do it here _prior to making a new world_.  

You must RWG a new world if you wan tto see new COmmunity made POIs from this section. 

**DO NOT DISABLE PREFABS/POIs MID-SAVE!**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12161046-e02b-49f2-9b8f-a5141c956e07)


### Standard Mods are what I (FNS) imagined as integral to this modpack.  

_Most_ of the mods can be disabled here, but you should start a new game if you do so.

We have a saying in my house when children are skiddish to trying new foods: "Trust the Chef!".  

What I mean is: Try playing the list _as is_ before monkeying around with the Standard Mods.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857bd756-de35-420b-92b9-c8ec248b4cfd)


### Optional Quality of Life (QoL) Mods are to be enabled/disabled as you so choose for your personal preference.  

But again, it's best practice to start a new game anytime you alter mods.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e5a4b37-03e1-4b5b-bad6-d702667f1d44)

_It's unwise to disable/enable mods midgame unless you know what you are doing as it could corrupt your save._  


### I also left a separator/section for you to add your own mods.  

I populated it with "Less Annoying Slower Vultures" (disabled) just as a reference.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be21bd28-f205-4aed-86c0-47625c72cf46)

---

Choose only _One_ major **Perk Suite** Provider!

Choose _either_ "Perk Mastery" or "Legend Perks", _not_ both!

If you add Flogi's Perk mod to your MO2 Instance, disable other Perk Suites.  

I do not recommend Flogi's Perk Mod.  This is not because it's a bad mod, but because it can cause mod compaibility issues. 

<img width="1099" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbbdd9ab-bee6-4f93-ac43-5c3393a9b4a8" />

---

<img width="1103" height="122" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83e4a1a3-e555-4b4b-bd14-ed3150bcafc8" />

### **Apocalyptic Jobs**
Adds a whole bunch of new quest types, boss encounters, perks, magazines, and expansions. 
The subsequent AddOn mods help you configure Apocalyptic Quests by disabling features from it you'd rather play without.
It will largely take over the Quest menu. 


---

### **Quest Mods**

<img width="1100" height="313" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5acd06e5-c25b-4c5c-8e5d-584458419bd7" />


"**Quest Revamp-Gears Edition**"

Adds a Gears UI screen to toggle Quest mod options. Also adds some other Quest UI functionality for compatibility with other Quest mods.

This is very customizable, and I encourage you to tailor it to your playstyle. 

One major change I made by executive decision. You can now move up Quest tier after 1 job instead of 10. 

That just alarmed some of you, and you're out there shouting: "Why?!"

Fin's the master chef cooking you up somehting nice, so hear me out on describing this dish:

Because it rewards players who have the balls to want to tackle harder POIs earlier. 

It also keeps you from having to do the same old tier 1-3 POIs you always do. 

If you can handle higher tier POIs, why not?

No one is forcing you to do higher tier POIs. 

Yes, this can throw off balance a bit, but it encourages players to make a risk vs reward decision.

I personally find being stuck doing tier 1-3 POIs in order to stifle my play style. 

I want to have the freedom to challenge myself, but I also want to be properly compensated!

This setting is *Chef's Kiss.  

And, most importantly: If you don't like the change, you can either disable the mod, or change it back to 10 in the Gears Mods menu UI.

Caution: If you did a quest for Rekt that opens up the next quest tier level with Rekt, please remember to reset quests!

This is important if you bounce between traders before reseting jobs!

Example of what not to do: Finish one job with Rekt, immediately go see Jen, take a tier 2 quest from Jen, cannot find/interact with that Quest Marker.

If you complete a job, you can reset the trader jobs to open up the next tier level!  This should resolve any missing Quest Markers.

### **Unsupported Smorgasbord Mods**


If you feel like putting them back into your own game, and are willing to troubleshoot, have at it.


The following mods were removed because I am trying to reduce Warnings and "tolerable" Errors on the list to make it easier for me to troubleshoot.  


If you are willing to troubleshoot things _YOURSELF_, you can add them back into your own game.


"Telric's Decorations" 

"Flogi's Perk mods" 

"Flogi's Quest Mod"

"DoubleBlundy's Bounty Quests" 

"Trader Quest Addendum" 

"Blood Moon Loot Bags" 

"Wandering Horde Loot Bags"

"Telric's Compact Health Bar"

"TWD POI Pack" Ignorant users kept saying my ModList had messed up textures and RWG issues... it kept being these POIs.

"Random zombie idle movement speed" 

"Beefy Hordes by GR" WalkerSim is superior.  

"Stack Increaser suite" Just back to the one from StallionsDen... want more, add them yourself. 

"OCB Pretty Grass" These worked fine, but I prefer BetterBiomes.

"OCB More Flowers and Plants" These worked fine, but I prefer BetterBiomes.


Here are some popular off-site (not included in the list) mods that were (and might still be) compatible with this ModList if you want to add them to your own game:

https://7daystodiemods.com/non-script-radios-video-games/


### How to add your own mods to the list:


You can download these mods, drag the zip folders into the Downloads folder within the MO2 folder for this ModList.  

Then drag them from there into MO2, in the Yellow "Where you may choose to add compatible Mods..." section in the MO2 ModList.  

If Mods are double-nested, or missing a folder layer, you will need to fix that yourself.  

## Optional Overpowered Mods are to be enabled/disabled at a players discretion.  
But again, it's best practice to start a new game anytime you alter mods. 

None of the "OP" mods listed here are aggregiously OP.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92de5741-a517-44d0-9ba3-cf13bbd55760)

## Optional Performance and Graphics Tweaks (These mods may be hardware specific and might require additional knowledge to use correctly)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e155fa9d-e533-42c3-ac05-4ad4ae3f196b)


## Vehicle Mods (Do not toggle mid-save)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75efa4c8-c03c-434f-a43e-be8566c127a9)


## Zombie Spawning Options

## How to configure the "Better Storms Biome Progression and More" blocks.xml file.


Watch this video for a faster explanation:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xQ8yYey9lU


<img width="1796" height="681" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8bf0393-8bc8-4254-af89-e7d1768e14b7" />

Open the blocks.xml file from within the Better Storms Biome Progression and More mods folder from the MO2 installation.
Within the mO2 application, you can right-click the mod, and "Open in Explorer"
-> zzz_RebirthMods -> Config -> blocks.xml


<img width="1096" height="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b1766e-4e20-4999-9228-3a3636b41273" />


I prefer to use the free application Notepad++ for editing xml.
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

Inside the blocks.xml file, you can edit values. turn false to true, or change numbers and percentages as you like.  

Then save the blocks.xml file.

It would be wise for you to make a copy of your edits as every update will overwrite your changes! 

Store it outside of your MO2 installation!

If you make a copy of the edited blocks.xml file, you can just drag your copy over and overwrite the modlist version.

## Step 6.  Launch the game from MO2.  

To play the modlist of this game, you hit the "Run" (Play) button from inside the MO2 application.   

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebb9b69-0be8-4adc-89e9-b4fc3bf47882)

> [!WARNING]
> Do not mess with MO2, or the MO2 files for this ModPack while the game is running!!!
> Exit the game completely before altering MO2!

---

## Step 7.  Random World Generation (RWG) 

> [!NOTE]
> You might need to delete worlds to make room for new ones:
```C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\GeneratedWorlds```

Once inside of the Game, at the start up screen, you will want to create a new game.
When you go to create a new game, create a new map!  
Create a new world with advanced generation.  I recommend 8-10k sized maps to see all of the Community made POIs.  
Random World Generation (RWG) will take much longer than vanilla.  10-60 minutes depending on hardware and map size.  
NASA boys in 5-20 minutes, potato-bros in 25-60 minutes.  

"Why does it take so long to RWG in this list compared to Vanilla?!" 
Becaue several of the Framework mods make significant changes to RWG.  
Larger cities, denser cities, more cities, more POIs, less wasted space between POIs (compared to empty maps like Navezgane), fancier roads, new tiles, new block types, The Descent mod digs a whole cave system under the world, etc.  
If you don't want it to take so long for RWG, you could disable "CP All in One No Traders" and "The Descent" mods, but then you miss out on all those great POIs.  

Do not make maps larger than 10k if you are using potato-grade hardware.  
It could crash in RWG, or worse, mid-game.  
Know your limitations, or upgrade your potato, don't blame me because you haven't upgraded your hardware in 12 years!  

Recommended RWG Settings for this modpack if you want to see a better variety of the Community Made POIs:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c318e31b-4926-45fe-8a97-edd045927889)


If you are generating a new world with The Descent mod enabled, and you see an error in your log exclaiming "DivideByZero" or "delaunay triangulation" this is not your fault.

The Descent uses extremely complex algorithims for carving out caves in the underworld, and can sometimes make a fatal mistake.

Solution: Generate a new world with Descent, using default Descent Settings. It's unlikely you should see this error again.

I have generated dozens of Descent worlds and not encountered this issue, but it is a rare oddity according to the Mod Author. 


<img width="1585" height="154" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/608e7000-f209-4df0-9829-2f2359152284" />


---

## Step 8.  Recommended Game Settings

**Loot Consideration:** 
Play with Loot Abundance set to 75% or lower.  
I prefer 50% for the challenge.  
There is more than enough loot from the "FNS's Loot All the Things" (LAtT) mod.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a541ac67-95b3-4d67-a6a2-9e92d7b260d5)

**Difficulty Recommendation:** 
Since the weapons from EFT and Izy are stronger than vanilla guns, you are strongly encouraged to play with higher than your normal difficulty settings.
Increase zombie speed as well if you can tolerate it.
If you want to see more/less zombies, adjust the Zombie Population Density within the WalkerSim -> WalkerSim.xml file.  
I like 180 for a comfortably populated singleplayer world.  
At 300, it's nearly impossible to get quests, or harvesting done, you're under constant attack!

---

## Step 9.  Your first time playing the list.

Mods can be very subjective to personal taste.  

Because of this, I highly recommend you start a short test game for your first time with this list.

Why: Let's say you were super excited to try NPCs. But after trying them for a few hours, you realize they're not for you. 

The good thing is, now you know.  The bad thing is, you will want to start a new game to disable them.

This is because some mods cannot be toggled midsave without gamebreaking errors.
Some mods, you need to commit to, or start a new save!

This is why I suggest you get in a short test game of an hour or two before you settle in for a long haul playthrough. 

You'll quickly learn what mods you love and hate.

## How to convert this ModList to run on a **Self-Hosted** Dedicated Server:


One of our Community Members named **Kajdaniec** has converted this ModList to run on a Dedicated Server using MO2.  

In Steam, you must have "Tools" checked in your games Library Games dropdown:

<img width="326" height="308" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/344aa76c-43f1-452f-8c73-0d435fdaef3d" />

Then you must download the latest stable version of the 7 Days to Die Dedicated Server tool. 

_The image might be old by the time you are reading this!_

<img width="737" height="419" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caae90e0-0274-42a5-9068-69ed94409b48" />

In MO2 -> From the top of the Application, in the Tools tab -> press Executables.

This will open up the Modify Executables pop-up window.

For the machine you are converting into a Dedicated Server, you will want to change the **"Binary"** and **"Start in"** line from this:

<img width="902" height="684" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7198d1f0-247f-4716-87d1-bd45c4f14322" />

**_To this:_**

<img width="949" height="687" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc6e7953-aeab-4b65-a30c-8193b35828cb" />



There are users who have used Kajdaniec's method on a separate computer, and some users who have self-hosted the Dedicated Server from the same machine they are running their own game from.  


Here are the XML changes he made:

## How to convert this ModList to run on a Service Provider **Hosted** Dedicated Server:

This section was largely trail-blazed by community member RipJammer. If you see him around, just give him a thank you if you used this process.  

1. In MO2, enable the mods you want to include into your Dedicated Server version of the Smorgasbord Mod List for your users.

2. Open MO2 -> change the top dropdown from 7 Days to Die to Explore Virtual Folder. Hit Run.
(remember to revert this when you go back to single player)

<img width="576" height="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60011efb-2f39-463b-9aff-5f991d4fd7fe" />


3. Grab all of the mods from the Mods - Explorer++ virtual folder that opened when you hit Run within MO2. 

<img width="2423" height="1226" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aca0fa81-ec26-4d18-93a5-9a39cb756c33" />

4. Within the Mods - Explorer++ virtual folder, Ctrl+a and Ctrl+c to select and copy all of those mods. 
From the top of that window, press the "Copy to" button.

<img width="730" height="304" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9c689e6-2719-4b81-9177-a8bb7ef9a881" />

5. Make a New Folder.

<img width="415" height="507" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52a60df8-1323-48cb-832f-46629b6607e7" />

The copying process can take a while. 

<img width="445" height="283" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/769482cf-44db-4c3e-9a64-9114f4645117" />

Once it's complete, you can exit the virtual folder and MO2 as you like. 

Your temp_mods folder is now full. You can zip this folder and store it online for redistribution for users.

You can host this with a Server Provider, a Google Drive (if you've paid for extra storage beyond the 15 GB free), or somewhere else like Azure.


I would not recommend hosting from Google for security reasons, but you do you. 
If you are playing with a private group of friends, it's probably fine.
For public servers, you open up yourself and other users to being hacked.
It's just not a secure platform, and I wouldn't personally download random dll files from disreputable Google Drives.


> [!WARNING]
> Do _not_ host this on NexusMods, or other mod hosting sites!
> **This is not your work!**
> Bundling other people's mods as your own will have negative consequences. You will be branded a mod thief!
> You are only allowed to distribute this to people using your Dedicated Server directly.
> If you ignore this advice. I promise you your Mod Page will get delisted, and account could be banned.


Next Steps:

Drag a copy of all of the mods you just made, and place them into the 7DtD Dedicated Server Tool Mods folder.


Configure and Launch your server as you normally would.


Remember, all users (Clients) and the server itself must have all of these mods. 
Smorgasbord has both Client and Server side mods. 
FNS does not have the time to track down which mods are client side.  
Make sure everyone (and the server) has all of the mods!

Your players must add the list of mods from your zip, unzipped, into their Mods folder. 

They must have Harmony present!

You must play with EAC disabled! Too many of the mods on this list will trigger EAC if it is enabled. 
I would be careful who you invite into your dedicated server when EAC is off!

If they are running additional mods out of other folders, they're probably going ot have errors.

FNS is not your paid tech support for this. You kind of need to figure this stuff out yourself.  


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



# Troubleshooting

1. Are you sure you are on the correct game version?  Currently this is 7DtD game version: **2.2**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35817f2d-4a25-447c-87ef-48097b12d104)



---

2. Is EAC off?  
Run the Game Launcher from Steam, and make sure you disable EAC.  
It CANNOT be set to ask if you want to turn it off at each launch, it must be disabled!
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5862c19-6d78-4670-aaf4-7c38c2d6cf88)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f18cab91-3e23-44fa-aa2d-1e6d214b0e49)

---

3. Are you sure you didn't delete "0_TFP_Harmony" from the base game files?

Typically here:  
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods``` 
If you did accidentally delete that file, run a File Integrity check from Steam, and it will redownload those missing files.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e86cbc48-27e8-4302-a38c-8fd607dbd0e0)

> [!WARNING]
> The "0_TFP_Harmony" is a required reference other Mods will point to.  
> If you delete it, or do something dumb like rename it, the other mods in this list will not be able to reference it, and will not work!


---

4. You are using the most up-to-date version of Wabbajack right?
If not, update Wabbajack, by downloading the latest version.
https://www.wabbajack.org/ 

---

5. Have you reset your Wabbajack files in a while?
   
If not, you should do the following:

Close out of Wabbajack.

Press WindowsKey+R, to bring up the Run prompt box.

Type (or copy+paste) the following: %localappdata%

Hit enter.

You will now be in a Windows Explorer Folder directory named "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\**Local**", delete the "_**Wabbajack**_" folder in that **Local** folder.

Now open the Wabbajack Application, Settings gear wheel, log into NexusMods from Wabbajack. 

Sometimes Wabbajack, gets _Wabbajacked_.  No?  I'll see myself out.

---

6. Are you logged into NexusMods from Wabbajack?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baea7e05-d215-459f-b9c3-fbfe936a31dc)

---

7. When in doubt, **Nuke it from orbit**.

Perform a full uninstall and reinstall of the base game, Wabbajack, and the MO2 ModList from Wabbajack.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fef51abe-817e-4a3a-a722-62b9539e7f9e)

---

8. **Graphic Errors and Unexplainable game freezes:**
   
My game was crashing, but it wasn't directly caused by Mods. 

I looked at the Logs, no (unexpected) Mod Errors, but there were issues at the end time of crash:

d3d11: failed to create staging 2D texture w=128 h=2 d3dfmt=10 [887a0005]
d3d11: failed to create staging 2D texture w=128 h=2 d3dfmt=10 [887a0005]
d3d11: failed to create buffer (target 0x5 mode 1 size 864) [0x887A0005]
d3d11: failed to create buffer (target 0x2 mode 1 size 72) [0x887A0005]

A. Update your GPU Drivers.

B. Consider changing your Video Setting Graphics to a lower grade like "High" or lower. 

C. Also, don't go monkeying around with graphic settings if you don't know what you're doing, or you will create errors.  

For most players, turn off Dynamic Mesh, play on "High", and leave the rest alone!  

Just because one set of settings works for your friends hardware, doesn't mean the same graphics settings will work for your system!  

No guarantee that game/world save can still be played in, you might need to start a new game/world.  

---

9. A note for Super Ultrawide monitor users: 

I'm sorry, you won't want to hear this, I know you want to make full use of your beefy rig and awesome monitor, but this game hates playing even at "High" with 5120x1440 resolution.  

The Samsung Odyssey series of monitors do not play well at 5120x1440 resolution with 7DtD, and it's even worse when you add mods and try to run with Ultra settings.  

This game is just not optimized for it.  Play with a more modest resolution like 2560x1440, or use a different monitor.  

I don't care what your GPU/CPU is, how much RAM you have, I'm trying to save you from the aggravation of the dreaded monitor-flicker black screen game freeze.  

I have one of these monitors, and I have tried EVERY troubleshooting trick under the sun.  

Nothing will fix it!  This game with that monitor is cursed!  

> "I'm not trying to rob you, I'm trying to help you!" - Gandalf

---

10. Two common problems, same troubleshooting steps.
   
**Stuck on the in-game world loading screen where it says "Building environment..."**

**Crafting bug:  "My crafting queue won't complete?!"**

Press F1, you probably have an endless wall of Red Error text dropping down like a waterfall.  

This is preventing the game from loading/working.  Ctrl+Alt+Del, Task Manager, end the 7DtD game task. 

The ModList is temperamental to the following conditions:  

**A. Did you add mods that weren't part of the ModList?**

I cannot vouch for compatibility for mods that weren't part of the List.    

If you added untested mods not from the list, disable the new mods.  

Maybe your existing game save/world will load in, but it's possible that world/save is ruined.

Example: You tried to add incompatible mods that weren't on the Collection list.  

NPC mods can be buggy with this ModList, which is why I haven't included any. 

**B. Did you disable/remove mods mid-play through on an existing world/save?**  

That world/save is probably ruined.  Start a new world without enabling/disabling mods mid-play.

Example: If you remove SCore, Quartz, IDC Core, or other support/framework/requirement mods, it will destabilize your save.

**C. Are you sure the Priority (Load Order) is correct?  MO2 keeps the Priority (Load Order) I (FNS) set... if you screwed it up, reinstall the ModList from Wabbajack.**

**D. This is probably your issue:**

You need to remove all mods from here: ```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods```

If you see this in the (F1) Console:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00b09726-c6f0-4097-9625-48623b7b831e)

Or this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f7a520c-2732-4995-80c2-454ffc0ff5af)

**You have to remove all mods from:**

```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods```

---

**The only mod that should be here is the Harmony Mod:**
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods```

---

11. Are you sure it's not your Antivirus software blocking you from launching the game successfully with MO2?

Recent user experience: "Welp, it _was_ my anti-virus... 'just added exceptions for both MO2 and 7daystodie.exe, and now it's loading."

---

12. Fixing Headers in MO2:

> "Help, I pressed something in the MO2 application and now the Priority and Separators are messed up!  How do I fix this?!"

Calm down, you didn't break it.  Click on the Priority column header in the MO2 application so it will go back to sorting by Priority.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c911ff8-f637-4b51-9e29-a6e52b6e3ef0)



---

13. "I am unable to play multiplayer with this modlist?!"

There's a ton of reasons you could be having that would cause this issue, but usually it's because you didn't disable Crossplay.  

Crossplay must be disabled for multiplayer using my ModList.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77ece60e-a5f7-47dc-bd0e-4826bbbe20e6)

It could also be several other reasons, like these:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f96d7fb-d9ec-458c-b1aa-55b2a9096484)

---

14. Unrelated Applications causing an issue:

A. Antivirus and Firewalls: Create an Exception for MO2 and 7daystodie.exe.

B. Disable/remove programs that could be preventing your game from launching: SteelSeries, performance monitors, Light-Controlling-HW-apps, etc.

C. This is an obscure one, but could be messing with 0_Harmony... Windows Security > Exploit Protection > Randomize Memory Allocations(Bottom-up ASLR).  
If a user has Randomize Memory Allocations(Bottom-up ASLR) turned off, 0_Harmony will not be able to properly patch any method and will cause null pointers on the first method that is called that is patched.  To turn on ASLR, go to settings, look up Exploit Protection, set Randomize Memory Allocations(Bottom-up ASLR) to On by Default or Use default (On).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ee4b18-7ef8-4956-9a23-e9b69e73322a)


---

15. Trees, plants, and textures flickering in and out?

    A. Go to Video (Graphics) settings and Disable Occlusion.  If you are playing with Better Biomes and Urban Decay, the author also suggests this.

    B. Some overlarge POIs like those from The Walking Dead POI Pack will not render correctly.  This is a game engine limitation.  POIs larger than 150x150 blocks will have cause issues with roads, textures, and spawning.

# How do we find out about updates to Smorgasbord?


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f77d02f-0736-401c-93a5-bb18235e76db)

You should track the mod from NexusMods. Everytime I make a Major update, it will show up there.

**I will post update notifications to Guppy's Unofficial 7DtD Modding Discord Server**
It will be the top pin, on my #fns-smörgåsbord channel at Guppy's.  discord.gg/WpVPJWj7Xk

# How do we update the Smorgasbord ModList?

Just like you downloaded everything the first time.  
The difference is, it will only download new/updated mods.


You open up the Wabbajack application again -> Browse lists -> Check the box for Include: Non-featured games ->
Select **7 Days to Die** from the dropdown arrow -> Select Smorgasbord -> press the Download and Install button.
If asked to Overwrite your existing files, the answer is **yes**.


Caution: You should not try to update my list piecemeal in MO2 manually yourself unless you are an advanced user.  
As much as I love MO2, it has one deficiency: Versioning

MO2, it's weird about versioning updates.

If a Mod Author is sloppy about versioning, MO2 will tell you there is a more current update available, 
even though you have the latest one, and it is trying to imply you should download the older-but-mislabeled-as-newer version.
So, this is why I don't recommend you DIY Nexus updates from the mods in MO2.

_Just wait for me to update the ModList._ 


> [!CAUTION]
> Sometimes you can keep using the same save-world and safely update to a new version of a ModList.  
> However, there are no guarantees this will be safe.
> It's considered best practice to start a new world-save when you move to an updated version of a ModList.  
> So, if you want to keep playing in an existing save, wait until you are done with that playthrough prior to updating the ModList in Wabbajack.

"What if I want to keep mods I added?"
You'd need to go into MO2 and add [NoDelete] in the mod name in the beginning of the mod name.
After you update, Wabbajack will spit it out at the bottom of the mod list and not touch it.


"Will it remember changes I made to mods xml?" 
"Will it rmember mods I enabled/disabled between updates?"
Nope. I don't have a workaround for this. 
This is why I only recommend you update the list when you want to start a new game.
Get a good long playthrough out of it, take a break, mayber play a different overhaul, and come back to us when you're ready.
You'll be back. :)

---

> A user asked: "When updating the list from Wabbajack, is it best to make a seperate folder and re-do the list or does it automatically replace files for updates?"  

- I generally do not recommend making multiple profiles.  Just update the same location you originally installed the ModList to.    

---

Always exit MO2 prior to updating your ModList with Wabbajack!

If you cursor-hover over the picture of the ModList in the Wabbajack application gallery, you'll see which version is available.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cf5544e-a59d-495f-8443-a9e7fdec0536)


When a new version is available in the Wabbajack application Gallery, you simply download the list again, overwriting the existing installation. 


Check the Overwrite Installation box.  Then hit the play button in Wabbajack to update to the latest ModList version.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6b1a2c3-e081-4ae5-b4de-0fb13fb2265e)


With the recent updates to Wabbajack (4.x+), if you are updating the ModList, you might have to point to the folder again for overwriting.

## On asking FNS for assistance with Troubleshooting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No Logs = No Assistance!

### You must send me your logs if you expect help.  

I am currently unable to troubleshoot via telepathy, so you must send logs!  

Screenshots of the (F1) console are not logs, so send logs!
If you send me screenshots of the console, I am just going to tell you to send logs!

# How to add more mods and pregenerated maps to MO2:

One of our community members, TNR Wilson, asked how he would go about adding the FluffyPanda MegaMall recently popularized by Glock9.  

In MO2, make sure you have your Nexus account connected in MO2.  

Hit the "Associate with "Download with manager" links button under Settings in MO2.  


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f199badf-137a-479a-84f1-00133d51c447)


Press the "Mod manager download" button of the mod you want to download at NexusMods.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e72a1072-a8ee-413d-8f0f-d8f06d92371c)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9daf6cdb-a1a1-4e3c-8a8c-07a916b9ece7)


Once it has finished downloading, you click and drag it from that Download tab column, drag it into the POI Separator area on the left.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaa5b733-370a-4d87-9075-0902bc91d6f1)


Hit "Ok"


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ab84a4c-5bb1-4fcc-83f3-06add7abfc27)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a938eef0-fd4c-4e71-a051-65e43421dd9e)


Then you must Enable the mod (hit the checkmark inside of it)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f80a41a-5bb6-4a27-94cd-280671eebdee)


Pregenerated Maps are available in-game when you go to start a new world.  

Unless those pregenerated maps specifically include them, you will not see other modded community-made POIs in that pregenerated map.

## FAQs

**1. Why did you leave the Vortex Collection Nexus Mods Manager system?**
   
After a recent Vortex update, it broke the stability of Load Orders.

If you're new to modding, Load Order (mod priority) is sacred!

You can't use an application that regularly messes up established Load Order, because it causes mod conflicts, errors, and crashes.

I care about game stability first and foremost.  

Users kept complaining that the Load Order would randomly rearrange itself between sessions when playing the Vortex Collection.

You need like a damn PHD to understand all of Vortex's quirks.  

It became too time consuming to help users troubleshoot, and I didn't like people bad-mouthing my hard work because the tool was screwing up.  

So, it was get the ModList to work in MO2/Wabbajack, or quit providing the list for users entirely.

Thankfully, the Wabbajack community was extremely helpful in getting 7DtD to work in their ecosystem.  

---

**2. "Why didn't you include _fill-in-the-blank-popular-mod_?" and "Why only include mods from Nexus?"**

A. It's my list, I added what I like, feel free to add more, but do so with care so as not to break the ModList.

If you have a good mod suggestion, and have tested it works with the list, please hit me up on the **Guppy's Discord #fns-smörgåsbord channel**. discord.gg/WpVPJWj7Xk

B. Mods from NexusMods are automatically whitelisted for support with Wabbajack/MO2.  It makes for less work, and less hassle for me as a ModList curator.
Including mods from other sources adds more work for me as the curator, and also introduces points of failure for users installing the list.
I'm not looking for more work.
KISS!

---

**3. Is this for just single player, or could it be multiplayer, or on a dedicated server?**
 
This list is designed for single player and small groups.

There are several users playing multiplayer with friends and family using this ModList.
I regularly host multiplayer games with my sons, brother, and friends using this ModList.  

Community Member Kajdaniec and I have confirmed the list works as a Dedicated Server (but requires all users to download it locally).  

We both had the modList installed and played a test game on his dedicated server.

---

**4. Do both the server and all clients need to download this entire ModList for it to work on multiplayer?**

Yes!  The community-made POIs need to exist on both server and all clients.  

Additionally, some of the mods likely also require installation on both client and server.

I don't keep track of which mods are server side or client side, so don't ask me.  

I don't have experience with dedicated servers, so I am the wrong person to ask to troubleshoot that area.  

A general rule of thumb I learned is this; simple xml mods are generally server side. 

Anything that adds something beyond a Config folder, such as; textures, icons, new items, UI Atlas changes, dll, meshes, animations, new sprites, POI, etc., will need to be on both server and client.  

EAC can stay on for pretty much anything other than when mods start adding in dll files. 
Then EAC has to be off.    
_EAC must be disabled prior to launching this ModList!_

To the Plebbit MidWit itching to correct me: YES, I AM AWARE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THESE RULES.

![Reddit_MidWit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5dd5727-a795-4a87-b85b-c239f5df01c6)


---

**5. No, you should not add this ModList to an existing save/world!  Start a new save/world!**

---
   
**6. No, this ModList is not compatible with other Overhaul ModPacks.**

No, I will not make you a version compatible with Darkness Falls, nor Rebirth, nor any other Overhaul Pack.

Not my circus, not my monkeys.  

Both Khaine and FuriousRamsey do their own thing for their own overhauls.  

Overhaul mods make too many big changes and are not compatible with many mods. 

---

**7. Why don't you use ModLauncher, bundle everything under one zip-file, or make a "real" Overhaul Mod like Darkness Falls and Rebirth?**

A. ModLauncher (ML) won't work for my needs in using so many other authors mods in a collated list like this.  
I tried, it's just not for this use case.  
ML is for "real" pre-bundled Overhaul ModPacks.  

B. This list uses over 300+ mods from about 100+ different Mod Authors.  
I cannot bundle their works into one zip file without each and every mod authors permission... see "herding cats".
People who bundle other authors mods without permission/credit are seen as scum, and generally get banned from nicer modding communities.
I don't want to piss off my fellow mod authors, they're good people!  

C. Khaine and FuriousRamsay have more time and talent to dedicate to their own "real" Overhaul ModPacks than I do.  
They make almost everything themselves in-house for their Overhaul ModPacks, or only use a handful of community-made framework mods.

D. I prefer a more modular approach to modding.  
Darkness Falls and Rebirth are both excellent Overhauls, but contain mods I wish I could disable/add-to. 
With my ModList, it's like a buffet table, take the things you like, and leave the things you don't.  


![NewSmorg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/507e39c4-862d-4164-b30b-c91b1cd1a6bd)

8. **"I don't like the ____ Mod!"**

Disable it, and move on with your life.  No seriously, don't complain, just disable it!

This is the beauty of using MO2; I provide you with a buffet table of options, you get to choose what you want.

Some Mods have requirement mods (see those mod pages for details), but the vast majority of mods in this List are optional!

Caution: If you remove a "big" mod mid-game, you might have to start a new game world/save, or you will have game breaking errors.  

Examples: Don't enable/disable EFT Extraction Pack, Izy, Tool Time, FNS LAtT, and FNS Self-Planting Trees in the middle of a save.  

Good Rule of thumb: A mod with a progression.xml file should not be toggled mid-play.  It will screw you more often than not.    

---

9. **This is not a "lightweight" mod list!**  

If you delete this whole ModList, or disable it in parts, you will (probably) need to start a new save/world.

Trying to play a heavily modded save/world in any game, after removing big mods will cause you errors... just start a new world/save! 

---

10. **What about normal Trader Progression for RWG?**
    
On the Generate World settings page, TFPs included a disclaimer that generating a world may break quest progression. 

If you start a new game, and see "NO TRADER" on the top right of your screen, here are your options, pick one:

A. Keep trying a different seed until you get what you want.  

Keep each Biome to at least 14% to have better results of every Biome generating a trader.  

Don't play with maps under 4k in size, or traders might not spawn at all.  

6-10k sized maps are good, 10k+ is best if you want to see more of the Community made POIs. 

B. Walking in to a new Biome will often locate a new Trader for you.  

You could manually find a Trader and complete the first quest missions... 

Since in the base game, the progression starts with a trader, it may work that way on the generated worlds as well.

C. Easiest Method: You could start your world with the creative/debug menus on, find/teleport to your trader of choice, then turn off those menus.  

"How do I use the Creative and Debug Menus?"

In the game world, hit the F1 key to open up the console.  

In the console, type "cm" and hit Enter.  This will turn the Creative Menu on.

Now type "dm" and hit Enter.  This will turn the Debug Menu on.

Hit the Escape key once to back out of the console.

Hit the Escape key again to open up the "Pause/Menu Screen".  

Now you can open up the POI Teleporter.  From the POI Teleporter, you can type the word "trader" in the search box.  

Now double-click Trader Rekt if that's what you want to do.    

To remove the Debug and Creative Menus, simply go back into the (F1) console and type those two commands again to disable them.

---

11. Interesting information about MO2 for 7DtD:  **It's a self-contained ModList!**

This means it shouldn't stop you from having a concurrent game of Darkness Falls, Rebirth, Vanilla, and Smörgåsbord by FNS.  

I would not use Vortex, or run Mods out of other not-self-contained packs because they will mess with other ModPacks.      

ModLauncher can also be self-contained so long as you set it up correctly.  

---

12. "Hey, does this Wabbajack MO2 thing bundle other people's mods without giving them the credit and Donation Points?!"

No, that would be unethical.  This system does _not_ bundle their work in a zip and pass it off as mine.  

From a credit and Donation Point aspect, it's no different than a user going and manually downloading each of these mods one-at-a-time on NexusMods.

The Wabbajack and MO2 applications connect the API to NexusMods, so it downloads each mod individually.

Mod Authors still get download credit, complete ownership of their mods, and Donations Points (if they opted in) every time a player installs the mods from this ModList.

Wabbajack and MO2 work in harmony to provide curators like me (FNS) the ability to create ModLists for users to efficiently download and run with.

It's like having a friend do the grocery shopping and cooking for you.  You just sit back and enjoy the meal.  
A ModPack curator (like FNS) provides the ModList. 
That's it.

---

13. "Does a Wabbajack/MO2 ModList require permission from the others mod authors?"

No, because again, as far as Nexus Mods sees it, it's no different than a user going and downloading each of the mods from the ModList independantly and stringing them together exactly as I did.
All the Wabbajack/MO2 applications do is make the process more efficient to use someone else's list.  It does **_not_** rebundle/repackage mods! 
Your boy Fin (FNS) goes to great length to ask for permission to use Requirements, and if an author demanded I remove their mods, I would honor the request.
But, that's never been an issue because we try to keep people happy.

---

14. "Is Wabbajack/MO2 complicated to use... do I have to use that black screen with the white letters thing?"

Nope, it's the easiest method to enjoy other people's ModLists.  No command-line-interface, just a simple GUI.

---

15. Is it difficult to make your own ModList for 7DtD?

That depends how IT-savvy you are. If you have slightly above boomer-tier IT skills, you too can create a Wabbajack list. 

The Wabbajack Wiki on how to Compile your own ModLists is great, but it requires you to read and follow directions.

Additionally, the Wabbajack Discord group is extrememly helpful in making ModLists.

Word of caution, they are very much old-school IT people and will shout at you to: #RTFM!

If you want to make one, hit me up on Discord, and I can show you some of the pitfalls not addressed in the wiki specifically for 7DtD.  

https://discord.gg/wabbajack

https://wiki.wabbajack.org/modlist_author_documentation/Compilation.html 
This is the process to create your own Wabbajack/MO2 ModList.  It now supports 7DtD.  Just ping me if you need help in making one.

---

16. How does MO2 determine Load Order for 7DtD in this ModList?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c2772d0-4f91-49e3-9718-1add277a269f)


---

17. Do you make any edits to Mod Authors files, on your list?
    
Yes, but only under **_very specific_** situations:

A. I asked the author, and he/she gave me direct permission to do so for Smorgasbord.  WalkerSim is an example.
I felt the Zombie Population Density was too high.  I asked Zeh_Matt, and he allowed me to diseminate that change to Smorgasbord users.
LittleRedSonja also allowed me to reduce the rate in which some of her special zombies spawn.  

B. Manually adding VRoid Avatars to the main Vroid Mod folder structure, so players don't screw it up.
Not really an edit, just a convenience. VRoid was made to have Avatars and Dances added to it.
I just do it for users to make everyone's life easier.

C. Fixing Folder Structure, non-existent file name, or adding missing files to allow the mod to work correctly.
Some Mod authors leave a mod folder out, or double-nest folders. I fix this for Smorgasbord.

Exception... I have commented out something within someone's xml mod to allow it to function in the pack.
D. Patching a bug in their xml. 
Example: Tool Time ha) a bug where you decreased experience points when mining. 
We fixed it, and had it patched for our community prior to the Mod Author updating their mod.  


---

18. Does Smorgasbord work with 7DVR?

Yes, but you need to manually install 7DVR into the base game files, then configure the 7DtD game to launch MO2 from Steam.

Because this effects the main game's base files, I encourage any 7DVR users to make a second copy of the base game in a different location.
Launch 7DVR and or Smorgasbord+7DVR from the secondary location.

Recommendation: Go into the Properties of the MO2.exe and set the permissions to Always Run as Administrator.

I have not fully tested every mod for compatibility, but so far, so good.

Use the directory path for where you launch the MO2 for Smorgasbord from:

Edit your Launch Option in Steam similar to this:
```"D:\MO2 from Git\ModOrganizer.exe" "moshortcut://:7 Days to Die" %command%```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d07ddd3-bb8f-4f81-b83e-b87cee03bd5c)


I use a Meta Quest 3, with the Virtual Desktop Application, to launch Steam VR.

Within Steam VR, after launching 7DtD, I Alt+Tab over to MO2 to launch the game.  

It then places the 7DVR Loader into the Steam VR overlay.

---

19. "I'm a Mod Author, and I'd like you to consider adding my mod to Smorgasbord." or "Hey, can you add this super cool mod?!"

I follow all new/updated mods on NexusMods.  
If one somehow slipped my radar, hit me up on my channel at Guppy's Discord Server.  

I will consider all good mods.  

However, they must offer something unique, that is compatible with other mods on the list, and be available via NexusMods or Git. 
I can't use Google Drives, Mega, or other sites.  They won't work, increase problems, or have cybersecurity risks I won't expose myself/users to.

There are like 372 Stack Increaser and 973 Backpack mods.  I don't want to add more of those!
_At this very moment, someone is uploading another as you read this._

Give me something new, or fun, that fits the list, and is available for Wabbajack to download and I will 100% add it.  

---

20. "**Why aren't you on Reddit?  You'd get more people trying your list.**"

TL;DR version: Not my scene. I hate doxxing, hive-mind, and how agrieved they are about everything.

Blog Post version:

Sure, I'd like more people to play Smorgasbord, but I really don't like that platform. 

I've lurked there in the past, and seen people get doxxed for wrong-think for having a contrary opinion.  That, disgusts me.

Giving people like that a platform is like handing a loaded gun to a toddler.  

They have no civility, charity, nor nobility in what passes for their raisin souls.

When I see someone post something they worked hard on, like a mod, or a YouTube video, the crowd just pisses on it.

It takes courage for a new creator to put their works on display... 

They're joyless cretins who only derive satisfaction by crapping on the works of better men.

There are are some good users like Cinnaspice and Zer0Wulf, who have plugged Smorgasbord there, and I appreciate it, but the majority of people there are toxic in their negativity.


Have you spent anytime on the 7daystodie subreddit?  
At least 50% read like they were written by this guy:

![IMG_20250715_111743](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/087936e4-6669-4393-87c7-bca9036133cf)


It ultimately comes down to this: the majority of them are whiney sniveling emotional cripples, malding on the sidelines of life criticizing those of us who provide others with value.  

<img width="1080" height="835" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4675fccf-2e37-4c61-b632-e01093ca4ec9" />


---

21. "Why don't you add nude mods?"  or "Why not add DoubleG's Zombies now that it's available on NexusMods?"

I'm not a prude, and I hate censorship. I beleive in freedom of choice, speech, and association.

I like Double G's Zombies mod, I want to add it to the list, but I can't for one reason:

It contains a female cadaver zombie with an exposed nipple. 
I would say it's medically accurate, and grody, not prawn-o-graphic, but it still counts as nudity.


Smorgasbord cannot contain any mods that could potentially add any of the following labels: Nudity, Adult, NSFW.
Just having a Wabbajack ModList with these tags will reduce interest from new users.  

Three amplifying reasons:

A. Guppycur's Discord Server does not allow NSFW mods.
Adding Adult mods means most Discord Servers in the 7DtD community would not allow me to post links on their servers.


B. Some of my original community members are parents who play this game with their children.
They play with profanity disabled. They're okay with violence, or use the mod to disable gore. 
They would not be okay with nudity or the creepier furry mods.
I'm a family man myself and don't want to push these people away.


C. YouTubers and Streamers could potentially get a strike against their channels if using these mods.
I don't want that to happen to them, and refuse to take on that responsibility.
Don't beleive me? 
I was watching a live stream on YT of a guy playing a FNV Overhaul, he didn't realize it contained nude female raiders.
He got a strike against his channel and that video taken down.  


At the end of the day, it's so easy for you to add those mods into your own MO2 instance.
I'm not judging you, I play with mature mods in other games, but not here in Smorgasbord.

If you want to add it to your own game, there it is:
https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/8212

Download and drag the zip into your MO2 "downloads" folder.
Then when you see it on the right of the MO2 application Downloads section, drag it over to the Mod List and enable it.
Put `[No Delete]` in front of the name of it so the next update of Smorgasbord will not delete the added mod.


---


22. "Hey FNS, could you make this ReadMe any longer?  I'm really looking for something beefy after finishing <ins>War and Peace</ins>."

It's long because it's comprehensive.  

For people who have been modding this game for years, they already know most of this stuff.  

The more self-service users are with troubleshooting their own problems, the less work and aggravation there is for me!  

Fin is not paid tech support.  Sorry, I just don't have the time. I do the best I can, but I am one man doing this as a hobby.

So far 2,000 people have downloaded this list.  I am expecting another three to ten-thousand users in time. I don't want to burn myself out.

It's always someone's first day, so I assume anyone reading this could be entering the world of game modding with an empty cup.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394e729-c90e-448a-90f6-f5e1111a779b)


---

23. "Hey Fin, we noticed you're, I don't know, a bit extra salty lately. Is everything alright at home?"

Yeah, I'm good. I don't hate people, I promise.
I'm just salty from years of working in IT.
I just don't have any patience left for dealing with the plummeting IQ rates among the general population.
There just seems to be a shocking lack of awareness-of-others, civility, decency, etc.
Like when you go to the grocery store, and see people randomly stop with their shopping carts sideways gabbing with eachother while preventing you from efficiently grabbing what you need.
That drives me up the wall. This is why Fin shops at 6am and works remotely when possible.  I just can't deal with stupid any more.

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="grocery1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd4cd04f-011d-4fc5-b2d6-02f8d7f89d25" />


Also, I'm the sort of person old enough to remember when PC Gaming required an above 8th grade literacy level.
Man, I miss those days.

## Remeber kids, Gatekeeping is not a curse-word, it's your civic duty!

## Known Issues

**1. These are some Warnings and Errors you will see when you load into the world.**

They're benign and can be safely ignored.  

The red benign "Akimbo" Error will be patched next time Izy updates.

There is another benign Error when both the Descent and Bait Bags are enabled. It's harmless.

There's a zillion Yellow Warnings... that's WalkerSim working as intended.  It's fine, no issues.

khzZombies has some warnings and is glitchy.  The mod still works, but is due for an update.


I have played this ModList for hundreds of hours with these issues without catastrophic failures.  


There is an "Experimental" Separator.  Those mods have not been thoroughly vetted. 

I cannot claim they are safe, but they are there for community members to test.  I sincerely appreciate the help, but it is risky to a playthrough.

## Mod Notes

---

"My game is still too dark?!"

Experiment with other Lighting mods in the pack, or disable all of them and play with vanilla Lighting.

Adjust your Brightness settings.

Default recommendations:

"Better Lighting - Gentle Contrast Edition" enabled as your Lighting mod under the Graphics Separator.

Also enable "Add-on to Better Lighting - Night Vision Goggles Booster".  It's great!

**Set in-game Brightness to 0%.**

This is how this game is meant to be played!

<img width="1157" height="243" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b03f6de-ed3c-479a-9e6e-34dc82bda5d8" />


---

**Vehicle Cruise Control**: When mounted in/on a vehicle, cycle the Q-key on the keyboard to switch from Slow, Sprint, and Off.

---

**OCB's Parachute**: You need the Parachute item mod installed on your chest armor, and a single use parachute item in your tool belt for it to work.  
When falling from a great height, cycle to the parachute item in the toolbelt, and use it with the item use button.  
You will have limited control of the parachute, and still might take a minimal amount of falling damage.  
It's a test mod, not 100% perfect, but it's super fun!  


---

**Key Binds for EFT/EFT Extraction Pack:**

How do I change firing type? From Full-Auto to Single-Fire or Burst?  Z-key

How do I switch to under-barrel launchers?  X-key

How do I switch ammo types from vanilla to EFT ammo on EFT guns?  Hold the R-key, use the wheel to select the ammo choice.  


There is an Add-on mod to the EFT Extraction Pack called "ZEFT_Extraction_No_Vanilla_Guns".  


This mod removes vanilla pipe guns from loot and traders, but you should still be able to craft them.  


It also makes it so the Trader rewards you with an EFT gun when you complete the initial Buried Supplies mission.  


---


**Izayo's All in One Weapons Pack (Izy AIO)**

Some Tier 3 and all Tier 4 Weapons require the Advanced Weapons Repair Kit.
If a weapon has a gold star on the icon, it needs an Advanced Weapons Repair Kit to repair it. Search your crafting menu for the recipe for how to make it... requires a Legendary Part. 

<img width="879" height="594" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d79aa1c8-5bd5-4082-9d13-fbfa1d0206ce" />
  

If you want to change the shape variation of the red-dot sight, hold the reflex sight in hand and press the right or left mouse button. 
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eb0d261-5834-4ac6-99b3-5a28cc924cc2" />
No, within the game you will not see pictures in a picture, this image is just a representation.  


How am I supposed to actually use the minigun?!
Take steroids first, then use minigun.  You can only fire the minigun in first-person while juiced on 'roids. 


Notice 10: How do I use the flashlight and kick?
When holding an Izy Weapon, you press the F-key to kick.
If you want to toggle the flashlight on/off, you can crouch, then press the F-key.
Or, you can swap to an non-izy item in your tool belt, and press the F-key. 


---


Ragsy's **Vehicle Madness** 

You must have this mod enabled when you start a new save.

It adds repairable wrecked vehicles throughout the world.

Please see this page for details on how the mod works:

https://community.thefunpimps.com/resources/vehicle-madness.74/


---

What about the **CompoPack**?


These are very challenging POIs! 


The aesthetics are a mixed bag.


This mod is a "historical preservation society" for every community made POI ever made over the years. 


If you don't like it, that's fine, but please don't complain about it.  Just play without these mods.

How do I use **VRoid?**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use FPV Legs, Custom FPV FoV, True Third Person, or Witos Camera with VRoid. 


VRoid replaces your standard character with a new Avatar.  
There are three anime characters to choose from by default.  
I will continue to add Avatars as they are added.


Currently. the older Avatars do not have all of their hand motions mapped to 2.x!  
I would recommend waiting until Avatars are updated to 2.x.
I will add updated Avatars for you in future updates to Smorgasbord.  


To use/change VRoid Avatars, in-game, open the Character tab, press the golden hexagon icon. Select the Avatar of your choice. 
It might look like the VRoid Avatar is overlayed on top of a normal 7DtD character, but that will clear up when you back out of the menu.  
You might see a stutter, or even a Null Error warning, but it will go away.

I will add Avatars and new Dances to Smorgasbord as they come online for 2.x.  

If you want to add the old ones, you must add those Avatar files (from individual mods) manually to the Avatars folder under VRoid in MO2's folder directory.

Dance files need to be manually dragged into the Dances folder under the main VRoid Mod manually yourself! 

Do _**not**_ add too many dances, either you won't be able to see some of them within the radial Dance (Tab) menu, or none of them will display at all.  

Pick a handful at a time to test what you like.  

They are very cute.

I will not be adding NSFW skins, you can do that yourself, no judgement, I just can't do that at Guppy's.

**How do I make them Gesture and Dance?**

Hold the Tab key on your keyboard.
Move the cursor to either the Gesture or Dance balloon.
This will open up either Gesture or Dance Option screen.  
Move the cursor to the Gesture or Dance of your choice.  
Enjoy the Gesture/Dance.
You can also cancel the gesture/dance with the Escape key.

## Mods to consider avoiding while using this ModList:

A. **Firearms Expansion 5 (FE5)** , **Pant's Weapons**

Ammo Conflicts, progression.xml issues, and mod compatibility errors.

---

B. IDC Core and Nomad mod suite.  

I really wish I could get this mod to work since now biome progression is an important part of game version 2.x.  
However, there are multiple compatibility issues with other mods on the ModList.  

The Nomad doesn't have full functionality in multiplayer.

IDC Core is boobytrapped to not work with any Storage Broadcasting mods.  

---

C. This Mod List is not compatible with the main EFT Overhaul, Rebirth, Darkness Falls, nor most other Overhauls.  

No, I will not make it compatible, that's too much work.  

---

D. "Brazmocks Archery", and "Falcons Bicycle Changes" are currently messing up the progression.xml code in other mods.  Until those are fixed, I'm leaving them out.  

If one of you guys want to try to figure it out, please help the community if you are able!  

---

E. "Active Ingredients", it was breaking compatibility with other mods in the list and keeping me from loading into a game.  

---

F. "OCB Advanced Pin Recipes"  Conflicts with various UI mods, might work with only using the vanilla UI.  

---

G. "SMX" UI Suite.  I like this UI Suite, but it throws compatibility issues with multiple mods on my Mod List.  
From the author Sirillion himself: SMX does not play nice with added workstation mods, and any mod that adds a progression.xml file.
If one of you guys wants to patch the SMX UI mod, I'd be happy to provide this suite on the list, but right now I have too much on my plate.

---

H. "More Shots" messes with Izy AIO crafting unlock progression.

---

I. "Tank" mod. Errors. 

---

J. "AGF HUD" recent update broke the Perks screen with Smorgasbord.

# Using the Lossless Scaling application with 7DtD

Lossless Scaling (LS) is an application that can produce Frame Generation and perform upscaling.  

It's a paid-for app available on Steam.  Normally it goes for $7USD at full price, but has gone on sale for as little as one dollar. 

It can be used on most games and applications.  In certain situations, it can help increase performance using Frame Generation significantly.

Can LS help increase performance on 7DtD?
Yes, but it's very system specific.  YMMV.  

I haven't tested it on older hardware, but I assume the benefits there might only be something along the lines of playing at your current Graphics settings, with a negligible performance boost. 

Normally I can play vanilla 7DtD at Ultra, but when I use the Smorgasbord ModList with mods like MPLogue's Better Biomes + Urban Decay, I generally take a 15-30 hit to FPS, with stuttering in intense combat situations.  

However, when I am using LS on a 3090ti GPU (has RTX), the Frame Generation works like a champ.  It makes my game run smoother with less stuttering.   

**Who would I recommend LS to**:

1. You have a Monitor with at least a 120hz refresh rate.  I am using a monitor with 240hz refresh rate.
2. You are capable of following directions to set up LS.  It's fairly straightforward.
3. You are okay with playing your games windowed.  LS does not support full screen on most games.
4. Having a GPU that supports RTX does work better generally, but not required.


If those things are applicable to you, you really should try LS to maximize your performance without sacrificing graphic settings.


And it's not just for 7DtD, you can use it on most games and applications.  
I also use it on a heavily modded Skyrim ModList, and see huge gains there as well.  


**If you use LS, you must disable the Vsync setting in-game for 7DtD.**

You can keep Vsync enabled on the Monitor, Nvidia Control Panel, and the LS app.

If you don't disable Vsync in-game with 7DtD, it puts the game into slow-mo.


Here is a great video on the benefits of LS and how to use it:

**Here are two different Profiles for using LS:**


1. **Fin's LS Profile**:

**Hardware:**

CPU: AMD RYZEN 9 5950X 16C/32T 4.9GHz

RAM: DDR4 3600MHZ G.SKILL TRIDENT Z NEO- 128GB (4x32GB)

GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3090TI 24GB G6X

OS SSD: m.2 SSD, WD BLACK SN850 NVME GEN4 2TB M.2

Storage SSD: m.2 SSD, WD BLACK SN850 NVME GEN4 2TB M.2

Monitor: Samsung Odyssey G9 Neo, with game Windowed to 2560x1440 @ 240Hz

Recording: OBS @ 1080p with 60 FPS.


**Lossless Scaling Settings:**

Mode: FG (no LS Upscaling, just Frame Generation)

Target: 60 FPS Average

Flow Scale: 75  

Capture API: DXGI  

Queue Target: 1  

Sync Mode: Vsync (in LS app, not game)

Max Frame Latency: 3

HDR Support: On (in app and Windows)

Graphic Settings: Custom, with the biggies set to Ultra, with a few options scaled down to High or Medium. 

Base Framerate Capped: 40 FPS in RTSS

Comments: This game is not optimized, and is also CPU bottlenecked.  

I turned off Laydor's Super Resolution DLSS settings.

I'm also using RivaTuner (RTSS) on top of LS.

Notice how I used RivaTuner to lock FPS to 40 for 7DtD, this was intentional.

LSFG works best with a stable FPS range.

My average range was 40 FPS at Ultra with this list, so I locked it there. 

I have tried a few configurations where I saw better visual results in some places, but had worse performance when stress testing the game. 

This configuration was the most stable for me overall with "good enough" Ultra visuals.

I also added a custom LS Overlay to RivaTuner... it's available at the LS Discord.

2. **Kajdaniec's LS Profile**:

MOBO: MSI X670E Carbon WIFI

CPU: Ryzen 9 7950X

RAM: Kingston Fury Beast 2x16GB 5600 MT/s

GPU: MSI RTX 4080 Suprim X

Storage: Seagate FireCuda 530 2TB (256GB OS Partition), Samsung SSD 990 PRO 2TB both M.2


Kajdaniec did not use RivaTuner, and has kept Laydor's Super Resolution mod enabled with DLSS set to Quality.


He's getting amazing results!

If you are willing to experiment, LS is pretty amazing.

# Donations:

I am not an e-beggar.  I hate being pushy, and will never be the person to ask for YouTube subscribers nor donations. 

However, community members have repeatedly asked if they can donate to me to support the work I do here for the Smorgasbord ModList.

If you feel so inclined, you can donate through the PayPal Donate link on my NexusMods Profile page:

Donations are always appreciated, but never expected.

I promise I will never treat non-donators like second-class citizens.  That behavior has made me leave other communities... golden rule and all that.
