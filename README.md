# Better7D2DbyFNS
This Wabbajack Modlist is the premier QoL Vanilla+ experience for the 7D2Dv1.1b14. 
It provides a stable and enhanced playthrough for those who like the base game, but wish there was more to it.

## Vision for this Collection

### It's 7 Days to Die, *only better.*

When people think of a stable Vanilla+ mod pack that enhances the original game, I want them to think of this Modlist.  
This list is friendly to a more casual play style for people who want a relaxed game experience.  If you are a hardcore gamer, this pack is not for you.

## Description
Most of the mods in this collection are Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to give the players a nice Vanilla+ experience without any game breaking balance issues you see in some other mod lists.  
This Collection is not about overhauling anything, nor adding too many new features.  
This list is all about improving dozens of small details that as a whole make for a better overall experience of the original game.  
Unlike other overhaul mod packs, you are not learning a new game. 
Balance is subjective.  Some people think this Collection makes the game too easy.  If you feel that way, disable the mods you don't like, and/or play with harder difficulty settings.
