# Better7D2DbyFNS
This Wabbajack Modlist is the premier QoL Vanilla+ experience for the 7D2Dv1.1b14. 
It provides a stable and enhanced playthrough for those who like the base game, but wish there was more to it.

## Vision for this Collection

### It's 7 Days to Die, *only better.*

When people think of a stable Vanilla+ mod pack that enhances the original game, I want them to think of this Modlist.  
This list is friendly to a more casual play style for people who want a relaxed game experience.  If you are a hardcore gamer, this pack is not for you.

## Description
Most of the mods in this collection are Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to give the players a nice Vanilla+ experience without any game breaking balance issues you see in some other mod lists.  
This Collection is not about overhauling anything, nor adding too many new features.  
This list is all about improving dozens of small details that as a whole make for a better overall experience of the original game.  
Unlike other overhaul mod packs, you are not learning a new game. 
Balance is subjective.  Some people think this Collection makes the game too easy.  If you feel that way, disable the mods you don't like, and/or play with harder difficulty settings.

# Installation Directions

Thou shalt read the directions and troubleshooting sections prior to asking for technical assistance.  

## Assumptions 

A. You have already installed 7D2D, using the latest *stable* version.  Currently, this is: v1.1b14

B. EAC has been disabled from the Game Launcher.

C. You did *not* delete the "0_TFP_Harmony" folder!

D. You ran the vanilla game to the main start-up menu once.  *This is so it can build out folder directories.*  

E. You are not running Mods out of any other folder that could cause a potential Mod Conflict.

F. You have an account on NexusMods.  A free account is fine.  

H. You are literate, and have basic computer literacy to figure simple things out for yourself.

### Step 1:

Download MordOrganizer2 (MO2).  

Install it.

### Step 2. 

Download the "Mod Organizer 2 Plugin - Revived" mod from NexusMods

Unzip the folder somewhere you can find it, and drag the file named "game_7D2D.py" into this MO2 folder on your computer: *YourDriveLetter:\MO2\plugins\basic_games\games*

Launch MO2.  
It will ask if you want to create a new Instance?  Yes.  
Create a Portable Instance.  Select 7D2D game.  
You want all three boxes to be checked.
It will ask where you want to store your Instances.  
I recommend making a New Folder, label it something like "Game Instances" and place it anywhere you can remember.  
Do *not* put this "Game Instances" folder in either the vanilla game directory and MO2 folder paths.

Good Example:
7D2D Vanilla Game folder path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die
MO2 installation folder path: D:\MO2
Game Instances Folder Path: **D:\Game Instances**

### Step 3

Download the Better7D2DbyFNS_Rev47_MO2_list.txt file.

### Step 4

Read through the Optional Mod list write ups on this Read-Me, and select/deselect mods in MO2 accordingly.

### Step 5

Hit the Run (play button) within MO2.
