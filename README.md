# Better 7D2D by FNS
This is an Overhaul Modlist for the game 7 Days to Die using Wabbajack and ModOrganizer2 (MO2).

## Vision for this Collection

### It's 7 Days to Die, *only better.*

When people think of a stable Vanilla+ mod pack that enhances the original game, I want them to think of this ModList.  
This list is friendly to a more casual play style for people who want a relaxed game experience.  
If you are a hardcore gamer, this pack is not for you.

## Description
Most of the mods in this collection are Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to give the players a nice Vanilla+ experience without any game breaking balance issues you see in some other mod lists.  
This Collection is not about overhauling anything, nor adding too many new features.  
This list is all about improving dozens of small details that as a whole make for a better overall experience of the original game.  
Unlike other overhaul mod packs, you are not learning a new game. 
Balance is subjective.  Some people think this Collection makes the game too easy.  If you feel that way, disable the mods you don't like, and/or play with harder difficulty settings.

# Installation Directions

Thou shalt read the directions and troubleshooting sections prior to asking for technical assistance.  

## Assumptions 

A. You have already installed 7D2D, using the latest *stable* version.  Currently, this is: v1.2b27

B. EAC has been disabled from the Game Launcher.

C. You did *not* delete the "0_TFP_Harmony" folder!

D. You ran the vanilla game to the main start-up menu once.  *This is so it can build out folder directories.*  

E. You are not running Mods out of any other folder that could cause a potential Mod Conflict.

F. You are literate, and have basic computer literacy to figure simple things out for yourself.

### Step 0: You must have a Nexus Mods account.

Free or Premium.  If you have a free account, prepare to do a lot of clicking.

https://users.nexusmods.com/register

### Step 1: Download ModOrganizer2 (MO2)

Download ModOrganizer2 (MO2)
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files

Install it.

### Step 2. Download the 7D2D MO2 Plugin v2

Download the 7D2D MO2 Plugin v2
https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5624?tab=files
Unzip this in the folder where you installed MO2.  
If Windows prompts you to overwrite the existing files in the MO2 folder, the answer is yes.

Load MO2 once, then exit MO2.  

### Step 3. Download/update to the latest version of Wabbajack: https://www.wabbajack.org/

If you already have Wabbajack installed, you must update it to the most current version.
Download the newest version to update Wabbajack!
Older versions of Wabbajack do not support 7D2D!  
7D2D only recently received Wabbajack support!  

### Step 4. Find the "Better 7D2D" ModList in the Wabbajack Gallery of Modlists.  

Search for the 7 Days to Die game in Wabbajack Gallery Search.
https://www.wabbajack.org/gallery
At the time of this writting, my ModPack is the first and only Wabbajack list for the 7D2D game.
Download the "Better 7D2D" Overhaul ModPack.

The Wabbajack Application will prompt you

### Step 5. Open MO2 launcher for "Better 7D2D".

When Wabbajack has finished the download, unzipping, and installation of the ModList, run the MO2 list for "Better 7D2D".

### Step 6. Customize the ModList in MO2 to suit your personal preferences.  

Do not rearrange the Priority (Load Order) unless you know what you are doing.  
I hand tailored the priority to avoid mod conflicts.  
If you mess that up, I cannot fix it for you.

_The following screenshots in this section were uploaded from Revision version 56.0 of this Overhaul ModPack._  

Do not disable **Framework/Requirement Mods** (unless you are an advanced modder and you know what you are doing).

**Prefabs and POIs.**  
If you want to add_and_enable, or disable any prefab/POIs, do it here prior to making a new world.  
DO NOT DISABLE PREFABS/POIs MID-SAVE!
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12161046-e02b-49f2-9b8f-a5141c956e07)

Standard Mods are what I (FNS) imagined as integral to this modpack.  Most of the mods can be disabled here, but you should start a new game if you do so.

Optional QoL Mods are to be enabled/disabled as you so choose for your personal preference, but again, it's best practice to start a new game.  

Always start a new game when you change mods.  It's unwise to disable/enable mods midgame unless you know what you are doing as it could corrupt your save.  

### Step 7.  Launch the game from MO2.  

Play the game.

### Step 8.  Random World Generation (RWG) 

Create a new world with advanced generation.  I recommend 8-10k sized maps to see all of the Community made POIs.  
Random World Generation (RWG) will take much longer than vanilla.  10-60 minutes depending on hardware.

"Why is it so long?!" Becaue of the mods, like the CompoPack.  
There are a lot changes to RWG to increase city size, more POIs, less wasted space between POIs (compared to empty maps like Navezgane).

Do not make maps larger than 10k if you are using potato grade hardware.  It could crash in RWG, or mid-game.  

You might need to delete worlds to make room for new ones:
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\GeneratedWorlds

### Troubleshooting
1. Are you sure you are on the correct game version?  Currently this is 7D2D game version: **1.2b27**

2.Is EAC off?  
Run the Game Launcher from Steam, and make sure you disable EAC.  
It CANNOT be set to ask if you want to turn it off at each launch, it must be disabled!

3. Are you sure you didn't delete "0_TFP_Harmony" from the base game files? 
Typically here:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods 
If you did accidentally delete that file, run a File Integrity check from Steam.

4. You are using the most up-to-date version of Wabbajack right?
If not, update Wabbajack, by downloading the latest version.
https://www.wabbajack.org/ 

6. Have you reset your Wabbajack in a while?  If not, you should do the following:
Close out of Wabbajack.
Press WindowsKey+R, to bring up the Run prompt box.  Type (or copy+paste) the following:%localappdata%
Hit enter.
You will now be in a Windows Explorer Folder directory named "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local", delete the "Wabbajack" folder in that Local folder.
Now open the Wabbajack Application, Settings gear wheel, log into NexusMods from Wabbajack.  

7. Are you logged into NexusMods from Wabbajack?
