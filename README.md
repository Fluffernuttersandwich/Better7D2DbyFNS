# Better 7D2D byFNS
This is an Overhaul Modlist for the game 7 Days to Die for Wabbajack and MordOrganizer2 (MO2).
This Overhaul ModPack is the premier Quality of Life (QoL) Vanilla+ experience for 7D2D.
It provides a stable and enhanced playthrough for those who like the base game, but wish there was more to it.

## Vision for this Collection

### It's 7 Days to Die, *only better.*

When people think of a stable Vanilla+ mod pack that enhances the original game, I want them to think of this ModList.  
This list is friendly to a more casual play style for people who want a relaxed game experience.  If you are a hardcore gamer, this pack is not for you.

## Description
Most of the mods in this collection are Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to give the players a nice Vanilla+ experience without any game breaking balance issues you see in some other mod lists.  
This Collection is not about overhauling anything, nor adding too many new features.  
This list is all about improving dozens of small details that as a whole make for a better overall experience of the original game.  
Unlike other overhaul mod packs, you are not learning a new game. 
Balance is subjective.  Some people think this Collection makes the game too easy.  If you feel that way, disable the mods you don't like, and/or play with harder difficulty settings.

# Installation Directions

Thou shalt read the directions and troubleshooting sections prior to asking for technical assistance.  

## Assumptions 

A. You have already installed 7D2D, using the latest *stable* version.  Currently, this is: v1.2b27

B. EAC has been disabled from the Game Launcher.

C. You did *not* delete the "0_TFP_Harmony" folder!

D. You ran the vanilla game to the main start-up menu once.  *This is so it can build out folder directories.*  

E. You are not running Mods out of any other folder that could cause a potential Mod Conflict.

F. You are literate, and have basic computer literacy to figure simple things out for yourself.

### Step 1: Download ModOrganizer2 (MO2)

Download ModOrganizer2 (MO2)
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files

Install it.

### Step 2. Download the 7D2D MO2 Plugin v2

Download the 7D2D MO2 Plugin v2
https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5624?tab=files
Unzip this in the folder where you installed MO2.  
If Windows prompts you to overwrite the existing files in the MO2 folder, the answer is yes.

Load MO2 once, then exit MO2.  

### Step 3. Download/update to the latest version of Wabbajack: https://www.wabbajack.org/

If you already have Wabbajack installed, you must update it to the most current version.
Download the newest version to update Wabbajack!
Older versions of Wabbajack do not support 7D2D!  
7D2D only recently received Wabbajack support!  

### Step 4. Find the "Better 7D2D" ModList in the Wabbajack Gallery of Modlists.  

Search for the 7 Days to Die game in Wabbajack Gallery Search.
At the time of this writting, my ModPack is the first and only Wabbajack list for 7D2D.
Download the "Better 7D2D" Overhaul ModPack.

### Step 5. Open MO2 launcher for "Better 7D2D".

When Wabbajack has finished the download, unzipping, and installation of the ModList, run the MO2 list for "Better 7D2D".

### Step 6. Customize the ModList in MO2 to suit your personal preferences.  

Do not disable Framework/Requirement Mods (unless you are an advanced modder and you know what you are doing).

Standard Mods are what I (FNS) imagined as integral to the QoL experience.  Some of the mods can be enabled/disabled here, but you should start a new game if you do so.

Optional QoL Mods are to be enabled/disabled as you so choose for your personal preference, but again, it's best practice to start a new game.  

Always start a new game when you change mods.  It's unwise to disable/enable mods midgame unless you know what you are doing as it could corrupt your save.  

### Step 7.  Launch the game from MO2.  

Play the game.

### Step 8.  Random World Generation (RWG) 

Create a new world with advanced generation.  I recommend 8-10k sized maps to see all of the Community made POIs.  
Random World Generation (RWG) will take much longer than vanilla.  10-60 minutes depending on hardware.

"Why is it so long?!" Becaue of the mods, like the CompoPack.  
There are a lot changes to RWG to increase city size, more POIs, less wasted space between POIs (compared to empty maps like Navezgane).

Do not make maps larger than 10k if you are using potato grade hardware.  It could crash in RWG, or mid-game.  

You might need to delete worlds to make room for new ones:
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\GeneratedWorlds
