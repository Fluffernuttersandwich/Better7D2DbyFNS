# Better 7D2D by FNS
This is an Overhaul Modlist for the game 7 Days to Die using Wabbajack and ModOrganizer2 (MO2).

## Vision for this Collection

### It's 7 Days to Die, *only better.*

When people think of a stable Vanilla+ mod pack that enhances the original game, I want them to think of this ModList.  
This list is friendly to a more casual play style for people who want a relaxed game experience.  
If you are a hardcore gamer, this pack is not for you.

## Description
Most of the mods in this collection are Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to give the players a nice Vanilla+ experience without any game breaking balance issues you see in some other mod lists.  
This Collection is not about overhauling anything, nor adding too many new features.  
This list is all about improving dozens of small details that as a whole make for a better overall experience of the original game.  
Unlike other overhaul mod packs, you are not learning a new game. 
Balance is subjective.  Some people think this Collection makes the game too easy.  If you feel that way, disable the mods you don't like, and/or play with harder difficulty settings.

# Installation Directions

Thou shalt read the directions and troubleshooting sections prior to asking for technical assistance.  

## Assumptions 

A. You have already installed 7D2D, using the latest *stable* version.  Currently, this is: **1.2b27**

B. EAC has been disabled from the Game Launcher.

C. You did *not* delete the "0_TFP_Harmony" folder!

D. You ran the vanilla game to the main start-up menu once.  *This is so it can build out folder directories.*  

E. You are not running Mods out of any other folder that could cause a potential Mod Conflict.

F. You are literate, and have basic computer literacy to figure simple things out for yourself.

G. If you edited or added ANYTHING to the main game folder directory, you will probably need to performa a full uninstall and reinstall of the base game.  "But why?!" you ask?  Because Wabbajack will compare the hash files of your base game files to it's vanilla base game hash values, and if they are off, it might cause errors in installing your ModList.  
**It's always considered best practice to use a fresh clean vanilla install for any Overhaul ModPack**
... examples of you molesting base game files include: adding a ReShade, SkipNews Mod, Skip TFP Loading Screen Mod, adding additional folders, making changes to vanilla folders/files, etc.  

H. Best Practice for all PC Gaming, and especially Modding:

**In Windows, you should avoid storing mods on your system drive (usually labeled as "C:"),**

particularly in locations like the "Program Files" folder, 
as this can cause potential issues with game updates, compatibility problems, 
and might even lead to your mods being accidentally deleted during system maintenance or updates. 

Here are a few specific places to avoid storing mods on Windows:
Program Files folder: This directory is designed for system files and applications, not user-generated content like mods.
Windows directory: Similarly, the core Windows directory should not be used for storing mods.
Temporary folders: Avoid storing mods in temporary folders as they may be deleted automatically by the system.

**Where to store Mods, Modding Applications, folder paths, and folders instead:**

My Documents folder.

or

**Dedicated drive:**
If you have a separate hard drive, consider storing your mods on that drive to maximize space and avoid potential conflicts with your system files.
If you have a spare drive (like a D Drive), store Mod Applications, file paths, and folders there!!!  This is best practice!

### Step 0: You must have a Nexus Mods account.

Either Free or Premium will work.  
If you have a Free account, prepare to do _a lot_ of clicking.  
Premium accounts will click once to download all of the Nexus mods, and at a higher speed.  

You can register here:
https://users.nexusmods.com/register

Remember these login credentials, as you will need to use them to connect the Wabbajack application to the NexusMods page later.

### Step 1: Download ModOrganizer2 (MO2)

Download ModOrganizer2 (MO2)
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files

Install it.

### Step 2. Download the 7D2D MO2 Plugin v2

Download the 7D2D MO2 Plugin v2
https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5624?tab=files
Unzip this in the folder where you installed MO2.  
If Windows prompts you to overwrite the existing files in the MO2 folder, the answer is yes.

Load MO2 once, then exit MO2.  

### Step 3. Download/update to the latest version of Wabbajack: https://www.wabbajack.org/

If you already have Wabbajack installed, you must update it to the most current version.
Older versions of Wabbajack do not support 7D2D!  
7D2D only recently received Wabbajack support!  
Chances are, you are running an older version.  
It won't prompt you to update from within the application, so go download the new version.
https://www.wabbajack.org/ 
Wabbajack will store multiple versions of itself on your system if you don't do housekeeping, so make sure you are launching the newest version... 
_*cough *cough, update the shortcut/pin on your taskbar._

_If you are new to modding, please see the "Assumptions" section of this write up above, bullet point "H" for where/where-not-to store things when modding._

### Step 4. Find the "Better 7D2D" by FNS Overhaul ModPack in the Wabbajack Gallery of ModLists.  

Search for the 7 Days to Die game in the Wabbajack Gallery Search.
You can do this from the Wabbajack application, or a browser as you prefer.  
I peruse the Gallery from the Wabbajack application (pressing the Browse Modlist button) personally, because I can stay logged in to NexusMods from it.  
https://www.wabbajack.org/gallery
You can press the "Game" dropdown arrow and select 7 Days to Die.  Make sure "Show Unnofficial Lists" is also checked.  
At the time of this writting, my ModPack is the first and only Wabbajack list for the 7D2D game.
Download the "Better 7D2D" Overhaul ModPack.

The Wabbajack Application will prompt you to input information such as:

LATER

_If you are new to modding, please see the "Assumptions" section of this write up above, bullet point "H" for where/where-not-to store things when modding._   

### Step 5. Open MO2 launcher for "Better 7D2D".

When Wabbajack has finished the download, unzipping, and installation of the ModList, Launch the MO2 application ModList for "Better 7D2D".

### Step 6. Customize the ModList in MO2 to suit your personal preferences.  

Do _not_ rearrange the Priority (Load Order) unless you know what you are doing.  
I hand-tailored the priority (Load Order) to avoid mod conflicts.  
If you mess that up, I cannot/will-not fix it for you, and you will need to uninstall/reinstall the ModList.  

_The following screenshots in this section were uploaded from Revision version 56.0 of this Overhaul ModPack._  

Do not disable **Framework/Requirement Mods** (unless you are an advanced modder and you know what you are doing).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07fed2a2-1379-4cc7-8c13-f06d4c307889)

**Prefabs and POIs.**  
If you want to add_and_enable, or disable any prefab/POIs, do it here _prior to making a new world_.  
**DO NOT DISABLE PREFABS/POIs MID-SAVE!**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12161046-e02b-49f2-9b8f-a5141c956e07)

Standard Mods are what I (FNS) imagined as integral to this modpack.  Most of the mods can be disabled here, but you should start a new game if you do so.
We have a saying in my house when children are skiddish to trying new foods: "Trust the Chef!".  
What I mean is: Try playing the list _as is_ before monkeying around with Mods.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857bd756-de35-420b-92b9-c8ec248b4cfd)

Optional Quality of Life (QoL) Mods are to be enabled/disabled as you so choose for your personal preference.  But again, it's best practice to start a new game anytime you alter mods.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e5a4b37-03e1-4b5b-bad6-d702667f1d44)

It's unwise to disable/enable mods midgame unless you know what you are doing as it could corrupt your save.  

### Step 7.  Launch the game from MO2.  

To play the modlist of this game, you hit the "Run" (Play) button from inside the MO2 application.  

### Step 8.  Random World Generation (RWG) 

You might need to delete worlds to make room for new ones:
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\GeneratedWorlds

Once inside of the Game, at the start up screen, you will want to create a new game.
When you go to create a new game, create a new map!  
Create a new world with advanced generation.  I recommend 8-10k sized maps to see all of the Community made POIs.  
Random World Generation (RWG) will take much longer than vanilla.  2-60 minutes depending on hardware and map size.  
NASA boys in 2-3 minutes, potato-bros in 10-40 minutes.  

"Why does it take so long to RWG in this list compared to Vanilla?!" 
Becaue several of the Framework mods make significant changes to RWG.  
... increase city size, more POIs, less wasted space between POIs (compared to empty maps like Navezgane), etc.

Do not make maps larger than 10k if you are using potato-grade hardware.  
It could crash in RWG, or worse, mid-game.  
Know your limitations, or upgrade your potato, don't blame me because you haven't upgraded your hardware in 12 years!  


### Troubleshooting

1. Are you sure you are on the correct game version?  Currently this is 7D2D game version: **1.2b27**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b908b39-5b5a-4012-bc6a-9b638bebd593)

2.Is EAC off?  
Run the Game Launcher from Steam, and make sure you disable EAC.  
It CANNOT be set to ask if you want to turn it off at each launch, it must be disabled!

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f18cab91-3e23-44fa-aa2d-1e6d214b0e49)

3. Are you sure you didn't delete "0_TFP_Harmony" from the base game files?

Typically here:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods 
If you did accidentally delete that file, run a File Integrity check from Steam.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e86cbc48-27e8-4302-a38c-8fd607dbd0e0)

4. You are using the most up-to-date version of Wabbajack right?
If not, update Wabbajack, by downloading the latest version.
https://www.wabbajack.org/ 

5. Have you reset your Wabbajack files in a while?
If not, you should do the following:
Close out of Wabbajack.
Press WindowsKey+R, to bring up the Run prompt box.
Type (or copy+paste) the following:%localappdata%
Hit enter.
You will now be in a Windows Explorer Folder directory named "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\**Local**", delete the "_**Wabbajack**_" folder in that **Local** folder.
Now open the Wabbajack Application, Settings gear wheel, log into NexusMods from Wabbajack.

Sometimes Wabbajack, gets _Wabbajacked_.  No?  I'll see myself out.

6. Are you logged into NexusMods from Wabbajack?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baea7e05-d215-459f-b9c3-fbfe936a31dc)

7. When in doubt, **Nuke it from orbit**.  Perform a full unistall and reinstall of the base game, Wabbajack, and the MO2 ModList from Wabbajack.
